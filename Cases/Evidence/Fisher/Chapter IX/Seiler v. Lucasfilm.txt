Brief Fact Summary
Lee Seiler (Plaintiff-Appellant) sued Lucasfilm (Defendant-Appellee), a film company that produced the movie “The Empire Strikes Back,” claiming that certain creatures that appeared in the movie impermissibly infringed on a copyright of Plaintiff-Appellant’s.  At trial, the lower court applied the best evidence rule of Federal Rule of Evidence 1004(1), and found that Plaintiff-Appellant had lost or destroyed the originals in bad faith, and denied admissibility of any secondary evidence.  As a result, summary judgment was awarded in favor of Defendant-Appellee, and Plaintiff-Appellant appeals that decision here.

Held

Since the contents are material and must be proved, [Plaintiff-Appellant] must either produce the original or show that it is unavailable through no fault of his own . . . [which] he could not do.”  The court went on to explain that:
