Jonas Stelmokas (Appellant) had his naturalization revoked by a U.S. district court, based on the court’s finding that Appellant had been a member of a group that had aided Nazi persecution during World War II, and because he had misrepresented his employment history when he applied for entry into the United States.  Appellant appeals the denaturalization order here.
