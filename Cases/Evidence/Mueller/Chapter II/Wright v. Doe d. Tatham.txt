Tatham, Plaintiff, filed suit arguing that Marsden was not competent and was child-like in his cognitive abilities.  On the other hand the defendant, Wright, argued that Marsden was sufficiently competent to manage his affairs and to make the will.  As proof, Defendant offered three letters as evidence.  The letters were written to Marsden by individuals who preceded him in death.

Issue
Should the letters be admitted to prove he was competent to make the will?

Held
Justice Parke issued the opinion for the Court of Exchequer Chamber in holding that the letters are inadmissible hearsay.

Discussion
