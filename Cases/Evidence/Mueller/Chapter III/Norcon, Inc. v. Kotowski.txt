A jury found for Plaintiff and awarding $8,494 in lost earnings, $1,850 in emotional distress, and $3.8 million in punitive damages.  The Alaska Supreme Court reduced the punitive award to $500,000.  The evidence clearly showed that Plaintiff was sexually harassed by Norcon foreman Mike Posehn.  Further, Defendant failed to adequately address the issued after Plaintiff complained.
