The prosecutor then showed that the deputy did not kill the old man, that the old man died of natural causes.

Discussion
The court shows that admissibility of evidence in this case indicates that if even a slight inference can be made, then the court should admit the evidence of a collateral fact.  In actual practice, the courts tend to weigh the value of the evidence against the amount of time that will be consumed by its introduction.  The more there is a direct connection to the case; the court will be more liberal.
