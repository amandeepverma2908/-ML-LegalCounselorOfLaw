Brief Fact Summary
The defendant, Meeks (the “defendant”), appealed his conviction of First Degree murder, claiming the statements of the victim were hearsay and that he should be afforded the opportunity to confront the victim.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When a dying victim makes statements to an officer, they are considered to be grounded in truth; a defendant wishing to object, based on the right to confrontation, forfeits that objection.

Facts
In August of 2001, the defendant went to the home of Christopher Graves (”Mr. Graves”) to find James Green (”Mr. Green”).  The defendant demanded an apology from Mr. Green regarding a prior incident where Mr. Green had shut his hand in a door.

As Mr. Green was walking away toward his home, the defendant pulled out a gun and began chasing him.  When Mr. Green fell to the ground, the defendant shot him.
