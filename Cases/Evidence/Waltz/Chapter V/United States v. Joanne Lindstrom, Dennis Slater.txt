698 F.2d 1154, 1983 U.S. App.

Brief Fact Summary
Defendants, Joanne Lindstrom and Dennis Slater, were convicted of mail fraud and conspiracy to commit mail fraud after they manipulated billings and treatment for a therapy company that they owned.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A defendant has to prove that a delay in bringing an indictment was deliberate and prejudicial, but a court can not restrict a defendant’s right to cross-examine witnesses for the purposes of impeachment.

Facts
Defendants owned Bay Therapy, Inc. with a third person.  Defendants hired a woman who became a key witness to the prosecution.  The witness worked with government agents to gather evidence of Defendant’s wrongfully billing and treating patients of the company.

Issue
Two significant issues were presented in this case.

Held
The Court offered holdings for each issue.

Discussion
The end result is that the Court will always support evidence that is highly relevant to a defendant’s case.  The State’s attempts to limit evidence in order to uphold an evidentiary rule will generally be overturned.
