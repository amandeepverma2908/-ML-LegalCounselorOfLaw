129 S. Ct. 2070 173 L. Ed. 2d 1146 2009 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
Respondent, John Abel, was charged with robbing a bank with two other men.  In order to discredit Respondent’s witness, the prosecution offered testimony that he and the witness were part of a prison gang that promoted perjury on the behalf of fellow gang members.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Evidence that is probative to the bias of a witness can be admissible even if it is prejudicial.

Facts
Respondent was charged with robbing a bank with two other men.  One of the men, Ehle, testified at Respondent’s trial to implicate him in the robbery.

Issue
The issue is whether prejudicial testimony that implicates Respondent with a prison gang is admissible because it is probative to the bias of a witness.

In this instance the testimony was considered very relevant and was able to override the prejudicial tone that implicated Respondent with a prison gang.  The Court will often refer to common-law prior to the adoption of the Federal Rules in order to justify the scope of their interpretations, as they did here to allow impeachment for bi
