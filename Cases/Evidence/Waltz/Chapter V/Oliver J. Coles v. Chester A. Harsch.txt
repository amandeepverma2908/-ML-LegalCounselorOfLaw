Brief Fact Summary
Defendant, Oliver J. Coles, married the former wife of Plaintiff, Chester Harsch.  Plaintiff sued Defendant for alienating the affections of his wife.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A series of small evidentiary violations can amount to a retrial.

Facts
Defendant was initially married to Plaintiff’s sister and hung out in the same social circles as Plaintiff.  One activity of the social circle was the wrestling of men with each other’s wives.  Plaintiff introduced evidence that Defendant’s attention to Plaintiff’s wife was beyond the norm for their circle, and it led to the divorce of Plaintiff and his wife, whom Defendant married shortly thereafter.

Issue
There are several issues presented in this case.

Held
The court made the following holdings.

Discussion
The court delivered a laundry list of evidentiary mishaps from the lower court.  The common thread is that evidence purported to fall under one evidentiary ruling will not be allowed when the evidence is obviously meant to be more prejudicial than relevant.
