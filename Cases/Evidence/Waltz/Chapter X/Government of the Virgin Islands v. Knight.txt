989 F.2d 619 (3d Cir. 1993)

Brief Fact Summary
The defendant, Henry Knight (the “defendant”), beat the victim, Andreas Miller (”Mr. Miller”), in the head with a pistol, and the pistol discharged during the beating killing Mr. Miller.  The defendant was charged with second degree murder, and was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter and of two weapons charges.  The defendant admitted to the beating, but contended the shooting was accidental

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Witness testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those inferences or opinions which are rationally based on the perception of the witness and helpful to a clear understanding of the witness’ testimony or the determination of fact in issue.

Facts
The defendant was striking Mr. Miller in the head with a pistol when the gun fired and killed Mr. Miller.  The defendant was indicted for two firearms violations and second degree murder.  During trial, the defendant admitted grabbing Mr. Miller and striking him with a gun, but claims the gun discharged accidentally.  The district court did not allow eyewitnesses or the investigating officer to offer their opinion that the discharge of the gun was accidental.

Issue
Was it reversible error to exclude the testimony regarding whether the firing of the gun was accidental?

Held
Circuit Judge Cowen issued the opinion of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals (”Third Circuit”) and found that while the district court did err in excluding the eyewitness testimony, such error did not prejudice the defendant.  Thus, the conviction is affirmed.

Discussion
The police officer’s opinion was properly excluded because he did not observe the assault, thus he did not have first hand knowledge.
