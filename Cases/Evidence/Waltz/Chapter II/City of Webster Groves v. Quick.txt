Brief Fact Summary
This is an excerpt from a hearsay argument in which the defendant, Quick (the “defendant”) argued that the court erred in allowing a Police officer to read the electric timer which was used to show he was speeding.

It is not hearsay when a the person who keeps records in the ordinary course of business, or the person who regularly uses a machine reads the contents of such machine or records.

Facts
A complaint was filed against the defendant for speeding, in violation of the City of Webster Groves’ speed ordinance.  The defendant appealed the court’s decision that he was speeding, arguing that it was hearsay to allow the Police Officer who filed the complaint to read the electric timer which showed that he was traveling at a speed of forty miles per hour.

Issue
Whether a reading of a machine is hearsay because it is given by a person who receives the information and uses it to assert the truth of the matter in court?

Held
Hearsay cannot be applied to what a witness, through his own senses or by scientific instrumentation observed.
