931 F. Supp. 733 (D. Nev. 1996)

Brief Fact Summary
The plaintiff and defendant were in a traffic accident.  The plaintiff admitted a record of the defendant’s misdemeanor conviction for failure to use due care in operation of his vehicle.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A record of a misdemeanor conviction is not admissible under the Federal Rule of Evidence (”FRE”) Rule 802 because it is not a felony, but it could still be admitted under FRE Rule 803(8) as a public record.

Facts
The defendant was cited for failure to use due care in operating his vehicle right before he was in a traffic accident with the plaintiff.  The plaintiff wanted to introduce the conviction record to prove the defendant’s negligence.

Issue
Whether a misdemeanor conviction can be admitted as evidence?

Held
The misdemeanor conviction can be admitted as evidence as a public record.  In this case, it is admissible under FRE Rule 803(8) as a public record, or it is admissible under state law evidentiary rules.

Discussion
FRE Rule 802 restricts non-felony convictions because they are less reliable.  Parties are not as motivated to prove their innocence to the extent they would if it was a felony.  The point is moot if the court allows the misdemeanor under the public records exception.
