Brief Fact Summary

Facts

Plaintiff moved to question Defendant’s counsel to determine whether counsel advised Defendant of the place and time of trial.  The counsel would not disclose the information, citing attorney-client privilege.

Issue
The issue is whether attorney-client privilege can prevent Defendant’s counsel from disclosing whether he advised Defendant of the place and time of trial.

Held
The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania held that the advising of the place and time of a trial is not information protected by the attorney-client privilege because it did not pertain to the subject matter of the legal matter originally at issue.

Discussion
The attorney-client privilege will not extend to the protect counsel’s disclosure on the procedural aspects of the trial such as time and place.
