Brief Fact Summary
Petitioners purchased an outstanding judgment from the estate of Mary Harahn.  The debtor paid the judgment to Petitioners and they realized a profit.

Gain realized not from a sale or exchange of a capital asset may not be treated as a capital loss or gain.

Facts

Howard Cole paid Petitioners $21,160 as full settlement of the judgment.  Each Petitioner reported the profit as a long-term capital gain.  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the profit should count as ordinary income.

Issue
Whether the gain is ordinary income or capital gain

Held
Judge Johnson issued the opinion for the Tax Court in affirming the Commissioner and holding that the gain is ordinary income.

Discussion
