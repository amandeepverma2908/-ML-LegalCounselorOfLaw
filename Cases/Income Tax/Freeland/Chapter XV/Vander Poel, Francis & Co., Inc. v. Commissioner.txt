Facts
A majority of the facts are omitted from the text.  Petitioner, Vander Poel, Francis & Co., Inc., deducted the salaries paid to two of its officers, Vander Poel and Francis.  However, the entire amount of their salary was not actually paid in the year it was deducted by Petitioners.  The Commissioner did not allow the full deduction.

Issue
Whether Petitioner is entitled to deduct the full amount of its two officersâ€™ salaries even though the full amount was not paid in the tax year?

Held
The Tax Court affirmed the Commissioner and held that the full amount may not be deducted.

Discussion
The Tax Court found that there was no actual payment in the year it was deducted and it should not be counted as such.  Even though there may be constructive receipt, it does not follow that their was constructive payment for tax purposes.
