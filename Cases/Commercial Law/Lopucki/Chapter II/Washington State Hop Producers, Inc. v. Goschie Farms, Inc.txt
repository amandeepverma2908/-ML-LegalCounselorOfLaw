Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff Washington State Hop Producers, Inc. brought an action against Defendant Goschie Farms, Inc. to enforce the contract. Plaintiff appeals from a judgment of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the trial court’s decision to grant summary judgment to Defendant.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A contract may be rescinded under the doctrine of “frustration of purpose” by determining that the principal purpose of the party to enter into the contract was frustrated without fault of either of the contracting parties.

Facts
From 1965 until 1985, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) required hop growers to obtain Federal allotments in order to market their hops; this was called a hop base. Hop base became a scarce, expensive commodity and a secondary market developed for trading. Plaintiff was organized in 1979 to acquire, lease and sell federal hop base. Since the system restricted entry, the USDA considered making various efforts to change it, but by June 1985 substantial changes in the marketing order were not expected. On May 31, 1985, Plaintiff mailed invitations to bid on two pools of hop base for sale. On June 21, 1985, Plaintiff mailed notices of award to bids in the $0.5 to $0.76 range, including Defendant and other respondents. On June 27, 1985, the USDA terminated the marketing order effective December 31, 1985. Defendant refused to perform on the contract. Plaintiff was able to sell 50% of one of the pools for price of $0.7 per pound compared with earlier successful bids
