Brief Fact Summary
Taylor (Plaintiff) sued Caldwell (Defendant) for breach of contract to rent out Defendant’s facility for four concert dates.

Facts

After the signing of the contract, but before the first contract, the concert hall was destroyed by fire. The destruction was without fault of either party and was so extensive that the concerts could not be given.

Issue
Whether the loss suffered by Plaintiffs, is recoverable from the Defendant?

Held
No.

Discussion
This is the case where the doctrine of impossibility through destruction of the subject matter was established in this case.
