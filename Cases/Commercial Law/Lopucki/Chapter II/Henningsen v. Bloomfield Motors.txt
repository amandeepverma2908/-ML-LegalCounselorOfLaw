Brief Fact Summary
Helen Henningsen (Plaintiff), wife of the purchaser, Claus Henningsen, was allowed to recover for personal injury against the dealer, Bloomfield Motors (Defendant) and the manufacturer, Chrysler Corporation.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An express warranty, which limits the manufacturer’s liability to replace defective parts is against public policy.

Facts
In this action for personal injury against the Defendant, the court held that lack of privity would not bar Plaintiff’s suit. The court decision concluding that disclaimer of warranty clause in the contract, which limited warranty protection to the purchaser and to the replacement of defective parts, was invalid.

Issue
Whether an express warranty which limits the manufacturer’s liability to replace defective parts and which disclaims other express or implied warranties is valid?

Held
No.

Discussion
The seller of mechanical goods, such as appliances and machines, supply various warranty clauses, including: (1) disclaimer of implied warranty; (2) expressly warranty the goods against defects in material and workmanship; (3) limit the buyer’s remedies; (4) limit the time within which claims under the express warranty can be made; and (5) exclude liability for consequential damages.
