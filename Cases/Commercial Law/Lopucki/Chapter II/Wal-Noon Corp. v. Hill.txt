Brief Fact Summary
Wal-Noon Corp. (Plaintiff) sued Hill (Defendant) to recover damages for repairs made to Plaintiff’s roof under the lease agreement. Plaintiff appealed from a judgment, holding that the Plaintiff breached the lease agreement.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Performance of an express covenant to repair is conditioned on notice from the tenant.

Facts
Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a lease agreement for the construction and occupancy of a building. Part of the building was to be occupied and used by Plaintiff for a market, and the other part was to be sublet by the Plaintiff for various satellite enterprises. The roof started to leak about ten years after the agreement was made. Complaints were made to Plaintiff by other tenants of similar leaky conditions. Repairs were made to the roof by the Plaintiff until the roofers told the Plaintiff that repair was no longer practicable and a new roof should be installed. Plaintiffs sought and obtained competitive bids for replacing the roof and awarded the job to the lowest bidder. The lease stated that the lessor agreed at their own cost to make all repairs to the roof and exterior walls to the new building and the Lessors shall have no obligation to make any repairs to the new building made necessary by the negligence or improper use by the lessee. The lease further provided

Issue
Whether the lease provision concerning the form and manner of notice is a condition precedent that notice to repair be given?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
The court rejected Plaintiff’s claim that the payments for the roof should be granted on the quasi-contract theory of money paid by mistake. The court made this decision on the theory that where parties enter freely into contracts, it would be inequitable to imply a different liability and to withdraw benefits from one party for which he was entitled.
