Brief Fact Summary
Edwin J. Schoettle Co. (Plaintiff) submitted action to a judge for arbitration disputing the claim presented by Lester Kardon (Defendant) against the escrow fund for $69,998.42 as a liability of the seller under the agreement. Defendant appeals the dismissal of his motion to correct the arbitrator’s award.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Resolution of whether a provision is a condition or a warranty depends on the interpretation of the language in the agreement.

Facts
Plaintiff and its six subsidiaries were available for purchase. Defendant began negotiations for the purchase of the company. The parties entered into a written agreement in which Defendant purchased all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Plaintiff and its subsidiaries. The total purchase price was $2,100,00.00 of which amount $187,863.60 was set aside to indemnify the buyer against the liabilities of sellers by reason of any and all provisions of this agreement. Defendant presented a claim against the escrow fund for $69,998.42 as a liability of the seller under the agreement. The arbitration was submitted to a judge by the sellers. The arbitrator awarded to the buyer $3,182.88 and buyer’s motion to correct the arbitrator’s award was dismissed. Defendant appeals, contending that the financial condition on the date of purchase was less favorable than that reflected in the company’s financial statement and therefore he is entitled to reimbursement out of the escrow fun

Issue
Whether the provision constitutes as a warranty or a condition?

Held
The provision was a condition and not a warranty. Arbitration award affirmed.

Discussion
A condition is a stipulation or a prerequisite in a contract, in other words a future and uncertain event on which the existence of an obligation depends. A warranty is an express or implied undertaking that something in furtherance of the contract is guaranteed by one of the contracting parties.
