Brief Fact Summary
Grace H. Palmer (Plaintiff) sued Fox (Defendant) to recover the unpaid balance due on a contract for the sale of land.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Covenants to make improvements are dependent if the contract does not show that the covenants are independent and the time stipulated for the performance was concurrent.

Facts
Louis G. Palmer & Company and Defendant entered into a contract for the sale of a certain lot. The purchase price was $1,650.00 of which $247.50 was to be paid at the execution thereof and the balance to be paid in monthly installments of $16.50 each and the entire amount to be paid in five years. The defendant made the initial payment and also made monthly payments. The Louis G. Palmer & Company assigned its interest to Plaintiff and she commenced an action to recover the balance of the purchase price due in the amount of $709.02 plus interest. The covenant in the contract stated that the vendor agrees at its own expense to furnish cement sidewalks except one and furnish water mains and sewers. The covenant further provides that if the water and sewer are put in by the city, the assessment against the property shall be paid by the vendor. The contract also provided that upon receiving payment of principal and interest in full the vendor would execute and deliver to the vendee

Issue
Whether the covenant of a vendor to make improvements is a dependent covenant?

Held
Yes. Judgment reversed without a new trial with costs to Defendant.

Discussion
There is a presumption that mutual promises in a contract are dependent and are to be regarded when possible. Other courts, contrary to the holding of this case, have held that the doctrine of constructive dependency of promises should be rested on their fairness and not on the intention of the parties.
