190 F. Supp. 116, 1960 U.S. Dist. 3162

Brief Fact Summary
Frigaliment Importing Co. (Plaintiff) had a contract with B.N.S. International Sales Corp. (Defendant) to export to Plaintiff a certain quantity of chickens. When chickens that were not acceptable to the Plaintiff arrived, this dispute for breach of warranty ensued.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A party who is allowed to give testimony regarding the intention of the parties will have the burden of proof.

Facts
The action is for breach of warranty that goods sold shall correspond to the description. Defendant agreed to export to Plaintiff a certain quantity of chickens. Defendant shipped chickens that were not young chickens suitable for boiling and frying but stewing chickens. Plaintiff rejected the shipment of stewing chickens claiming that the contract contemplated young chickens. Plaintiff sued Defendant for breach of warranty arguing that there is a trade usage where chickens are to mean young chickens.

Issue
Whether the party providing testimony regarding the intention of the parties will also have the burden of proof?

Held
Judgment shall be entered dismissing the complaint with costs.

Discussion
The burden of persuasion is on the party who is trying to prove the intention of the parties. If that party is the plaintiff, his burden of persuading the court that the meaning favorable to him was the one intended by the parties may be substantial.
