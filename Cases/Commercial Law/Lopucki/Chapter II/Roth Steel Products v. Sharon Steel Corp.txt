705 F.2d 134, 1983 U.S. App. 28981, 35 U.C.C. Rep. Serv. (Callaghan) 1435

Brief Fact Summary
Roth Steel Products (Plaintiff) sued Sharon Steel Corp. (Defendant) for breach of contract, with emphasis on a modification contract. Defendant appeals from the judgment of the District Court for the Plaintiff.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A party may modify a contract without consideration as long as it is modified in good faith.

Facts
Plaintiff contracted to purchase 200 tons of steel per month from Defendant at a price of $148 per ton. Defendant also stated that it would sell the steel on an open schedule basis for $140. At that time the steel market was operating at 70% capacity and Plaintiff has a price that was substantially lower than Defendant’s book price for steel. Then the market was operating at full capacity and steel producers were experiencing delays in filling orders. Defendant then notified its customers including Plaintiff that it was discontinuing its price concessions. The parties then agreed to a contract modification that Plaintiff would pay the agreed on a specific price which Plaintiff was reluctant to do but had to do due to necessity. Then the parties operated on a different basis where Plaintiff would order the steel and Defendant would accept the order at the price prevailing at the time of shipment. Defendant had many late deliveries, but Plaintiff acquiesced to this pattern. Howe

Issue
Whether the modification of the contract is enforceable?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.

Discussion
In this case, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision on impracticability and modification but remanded the case for factual findings on whether Plaintiff gave Defendant timely notice of breach. On the impracticability defense, the court held that Defendant’s inability to perform was a result of its policy accepting far more orders than it was capable of filling.
