Brief Fact Summary
Paradine (Plaintiff) sued Jane (Defendant) for unpaid rent for three years. Defendant defends his liability on the basis of frustration of purpose.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When a party, by his own contract, creates a duty upon himself, he is bound to make it good notwithstanding any accident that he could have provided against in the contract.

Facts
Plaintiff sued Defendant under a lease for years for unpaid rent. Defendant pleaded that as a result of the invasion of an enemy of the King Defendant was forced out of possession of the property and was unable to take the profits. Defendant refused to pay Plaintiff rent for the time he was forced out of possession by the army. Plaintiff demurred and the plea was held to be insufficient.

Issue
Whether Defendant was excused from performance because his purpose for entering into the contract was frustrated?

Held
No. Judgment for Plaintiff.

Discussion
Here, the court held that the Defendant remained liable for the unpaid rent even though he was unable to retain possession of the property because Defendant bound himself to this agreement and should have provided against such incidents in the contract. Defendant also should have sought a remedy against the enemies who occupied his property.
