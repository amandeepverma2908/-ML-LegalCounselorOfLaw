Brief Fact Summary
P sued D for payment on a promissory note endorsed by D.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A creditor’s promise to forbear the collection of a debt “until such time as I want my money” is illusory and the agreement is not enforceable against either party.

Facts
Strong (P), a creditor, promised to forbear collection of a debt owed by the husband of Sheffield (D), if D promised to pay P should D’s husband not pay. The debt owed by D’s husband was presently due. P did not demand payment for 2 years. P brought suit against D for the endorsement on the collection of the debt owed by the husband of D. Judgment for P. Reversed by Supreme Court of New York. P appealed.

Issue
Did P’s promise to forbear impose a duty upon him?

Held
No. Judgment for D affirmed.

Discussion
An illusory promise is a promise in form, but not in substance. An illusory promise is not consideration for the other promise.
