83 Ark. 601, 104 S.W. 164, 1907 Ark. 117

Brief Fact Summary
Harrison, deceased is represented by the Appellant who inherited intestate. Harrison was thrown from a street car. Appellees, surgeons, performed a difficult operation in an attempt to save his life but failed.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A quasi-contract or implied contract is a legal fiction where although there is no promise or contract in fact, one will be implied by the law to remedy unjust enrichment.

Facts
Appellant representing estate argued that the deceased, Mr. Harrison, could not give consent expressly or impliedly to the surgery since he was rendered unconscious and should not by contract have to pay for the surgery.

Issue
Whether surgeons are entitled to recover cost of difficult operation performed in an effort to save the life of Mr. Harrison under a quasi-contract or implied contract theory.

Held
It was well settled that surgeons may recover the necessaries furnished in good faith to a person rendered in a helpless condition. Surgeons were entitled to recover.

Discussion
The Court quotes a passage explaining that implied contracts are found in the law somewhere between contract and tort and call for a remedy where none is otherwise provided to prevent unjust enrichment.
