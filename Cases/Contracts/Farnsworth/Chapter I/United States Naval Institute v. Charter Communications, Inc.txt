936 F.2d 692, 1991 U.S. App. 19 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1299; Copy. L. Rep. (CCH) P26,756

Brief Fact Summary
D breached an exclusive licensing agreement with P when D shipped a book to retail outlets prior to the agreed upon date.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Damages for breach of contract are calculated by the actual loss sustained and uncertainties are generally resolved against the wrongdoer.

Facts
Naval (P) entered into a licensing agreement with Berkley (D), granting D the exclusive license to publish a paperback edition of the book, The Hunt for Red October not sooner than October 1985. D shipped the book to retail outlets early and retail sales of the book began on September 15, 1985. P claims it was entitled to recovery for copyright infringement and sought judgment in the amount of D’s profit from pre-October 1985 sales, estimated at $724,000. D contended that it could not be liable for copyright infringement. The district court awarded P actual damages in the amount of $35,380.50, representing the profits P would have earned from the hardback edition of the book but for D’s early release of the competing paperback edition. The district court also awarded P $7,760.12 as profits wrongfully received by Berkley from displaced hardcover sales attributable to the infringement. P appealed, seeking a greater amount as profits. D cross-appealed to the judgment as a whole.<span class='heading'>Issue.</span>  Are damages for breach of contract calculated by the actual loss sustained by the non-breaching party?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed in respect to the $35,380.50 in actual damages sustained by P. Judgment reversed in respect to the $7,760.12 granted to P as an award of D’s profits.

Discussion
In calculating the amount of damages in a breach of contract case, focus on the P’s loss, not on the D’s gain and remember that the central objective behind the system of contract remedies is compensatory, not punitive.
