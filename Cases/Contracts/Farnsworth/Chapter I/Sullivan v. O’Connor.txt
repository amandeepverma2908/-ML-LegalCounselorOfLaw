363 Mass. 579, 296 N.E.2d 183, 1973 Mass. 99 A.L.R.3d 294

Brief Fact Summary
P, a professional entertainer, secured a jury verdict against D, a surgeon, for breach of contract in respect to an operation upon the P’s nose.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Expectation interests, restitution interests and reliance interests are used in measuring damages to put the promisee in the position in which she would have been had the promise been performed.

Facts
Sullivan (P) entered into a contract with O’Connor (D), wherein D promised to perform two surgeries on P’s nose to enhance P’s appearance. After three surgeries on P’s nose, D failed to achieve the promised results. The surgeries performed by D actually worsened P’s appearance and further surgery would not improve P’s condition. The judge instructed the jury that: (1) P was entitled to recover her out-of-pocket expenses; (2) P could recover damages flowing directly, naturally, proximately, and foreseeably from the D’s breach; and, (3) P could be awarded pain and suffering on the third operation, but not the first two operations. The jury verdict awarded P $13,500. D appealed, claiming that the judge erred in allowing the jury to take into account anything but P’s out-of-pocket expenses.

Issue
Is P entitled to recover for the worsening of her condition and for the pain and suffering and mental distress involved in the third operation?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
The promisee is often said to receive “the benefit of the bargain” and the interest that is protected is called the expectation interest. The promisee has a reliance interest if she has changed her position to her detriment in reliance on the promise. The promisee has a restitution interest if she has not only relied on the promise but has conferred a benefit on the promisor.
