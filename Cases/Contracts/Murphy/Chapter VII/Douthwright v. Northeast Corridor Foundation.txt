22 Ill.72 Conn. App. 319, 805 A.2d 157 (App. Ct. 2002)

Brief Fact Summary
Defendant owed Plaintiff a settlement based on an oral agreement to settle Plaintiff’s personal injury claim. Defendant did not pay promptly. This lead to a hearing to determine when and how defendant should pay and what interest is owed.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A debtor is discharged of his duty to pay interest on a debt when the amount of the debt or duty to pay is undetermined.

Facts
Plaintiff was severely injured by Defendant’s negligence when a load of concrete pylons crushed his leg. Plaintiff and Defendant agreed to a settlement in which Defendant promised to pay Plaintiff $2.5 million. Defendant’s insurance paid one million. Defendant denied that they were required to pay the remaining $1.5 million right away. Plaintiff brought an action against Defendant for the rest of the settlement. Defendant paid the $1.5 million, but not the interest before the court date.

Issue
Should Defendant pay the interest?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
Because the Defendant was obligated to pay the Plaintiff right away, Defendant is not excused from paying interest.
