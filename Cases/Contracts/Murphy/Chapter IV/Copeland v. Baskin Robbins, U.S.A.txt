22 Ill.96 Cal.App.4th 1251, 117 Cal.Rptr.2d 875 (Ct. App. 2002)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff entered into an agreement for the purchase of an ice cream plant, which Defendant owned. As a part of the agreement, the parties also agreed to co-packing, an agreement by which Defendant would purchase Plaintiffâ€™s products. Defendant formed a letter of intent to enter into the agreement, but left many terms undecided. Later, Defendant backed out of the co-packing agreement, and Plaintiff brought suit contending that a binding agreement had been formed.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
This case stands for the proposition that agreements, encompassing future negotiations, must be considered in light of all terms. If essential elements of the agreement are undecided, there is no binding obligation until they become decided.

Facts
The Plaintiff, Copeland (Plaintiff), expressed an interest in acquiring an ice cream plant, owned by the Defendant, Baskin Robins, U.S.A. (Defendant) in the city of Vernon. The parties commenced negotiations, and Plaintiff made it apparent that his agreement to buy the plant was contingent on a co-packing agreement, whereby Defendant would continue to buy ice cream from the plant. Defendant sent Plaintiff a letter of intent, outlining the terms of the agreement. Later, Defendant backed out of the co-packing agreement and Plaintiff brought suit for breach of contract and expectancy damages, based on the expected profit the plant would net.

Issue
This case considers whether a binding agreement arises when a promise is made, conditional on the fact that the essential elements will be decided at a later time.

Held
Affirmed.

Discussion
Parties oftentimes enter into an agreement which encompasses future negotiations. The key concept to remember is, when future negotiations are foreseen, if they deal with an essential element of the agreement, the agreement is not complete, nor is it binding, until those terms are agree
