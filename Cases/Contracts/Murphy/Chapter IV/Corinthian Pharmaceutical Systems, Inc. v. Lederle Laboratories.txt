The Plaintiff, Corinthian Pharmaceutical Systems, Inc., (Plaintiff) and the Defendant, Lederle Laboratories (Defendant), had an ongoing business relationship, whereby Plaintiff would place orders of DTP vaccine from Defendant and would be invoiced for the vaccine after the fact. Upon learning of an impending price increase, Plaintiff placed a large order of DTP and confirmed this order in writing with the office of Defendant. Defendant partially filled Plaintiff’s order, and refused to fill the rest of the order, citing the price increase and lack of proper acceptance of Plaintiff’s offer as reasons for doing so.

Held
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment was granted.

Discussion
This case stands for two propositions. First, acceptance cannot be made by a computer, in lieu of actual communication. Second, an accommodation by a buyer, in response to a seller’s offer to buy is not to be construed as an acceptance of that offer when the goods are nonconforming and the buyer clearly communicates to the seller that he does not intend to accept their offer.
