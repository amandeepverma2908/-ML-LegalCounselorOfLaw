Synopsis of Rule of Law
A contract can only be accepted by the terms and provisions that the contract requires.

Facts
Plaintiff and Defendant began negotiations to buy and sell a piece of real estate. However, the document stipulated that it had to go back to the trust for signature. A Rider was attached to the document that required in addition to Plaintiff’s agent’s signature and Defendant’s signature, the signature of the Trustees for the Plaintiff.

Issue
Could the contract be formed without execution of the document by the trust?

Held
