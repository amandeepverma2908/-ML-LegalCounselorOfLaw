22 Ill.250 Ga. App. 574, 551 S.E.2d 380 (Ct. App. 2001)

Brief Fact Summary
Beers Construction Company, a general contractor, was accepting bids for hardscaping/landscaping work in connection with the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta. Insite, a sub-contractor was preparing a bid for the work and accepting quotes for the landscaping portion of the project. SKB Industries, Inc. (SKB) prepared a bid to do the landscaping, which was significantly lower than all others

Synopsis of Rule of Law
This case outlines the rule of Promissory Estoppel and the four elements required in order to prove detrimental reliance: (1) A promise was made; (2) The promisor should have reasonably expected the promisee to rely on its promise; (3) The promisee did rely, to its detriment and (4) Injustice can only be avoided by either (a) enforcing the promise, or (b) rewarding reliance damages in an amount sufficient to put the promisee back in the position it was in, prior to the making of the promise.

Facts
After some deliberation, the parties realized that SKB was relying on using cheaper materials than the plan called for and the parties were allowed to revise their bids. Insite revised its bid to encompass the higher costing materials, but SKB did not agree to the final project and refused to do the landscaping.

Issue
This case considers whether promissory estoppel is available as a remedy after the parties enter into a subsequent contractual arrangement.

Held
Affirmed.

Discussion
Promissory Estoppel is not vitiated by a subsequent agreement unless that agreement encompasses the original promise as between the parties. In this case, SKB tried to use their subsequent working relationship as a tool to void their early agreement with Insite. This, however, was no affective, because SKB was never able to show that Insite stopped relying on their original quotation.
