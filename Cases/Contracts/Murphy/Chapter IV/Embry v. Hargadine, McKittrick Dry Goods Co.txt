22 Ill.127 Mo. App. 383, 105 S.W. 777 (Ct. App. 1907)

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff, Embry (Plaintiff), worked for the Defendant, Hargadine, McKittrick Dry Goods Co. (Defendant). The Plaintiff’s contract expired in December and he met with Defendant’s President to renew it for a year. The President said “go ahead, you’re all right; get your men out and don’t let that worry you.” The contract was terminated a few months later. The Plaintiff brought suit based on breach of contract.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
If a reasonable person would understand the oral promise to be an agreement for employment, then it is a valid contract.

Facts
Plaintiff met with the President of the Defendant Corporation and stated he would be forced to quit if he was not guaranteed another contract for the upcoming year. The president responded “go ahead, you’re all right; get your men out and don’t let that worry you.” Plaintiff thought the contract was renewed and continued employment. The President later denied making the comment and never intended to renew the contract, but just address the issue at a later date.

Issue
Was the oral promise by the Defendant Corporation’s president a valid contract?

Held
Yes. Reversed.

Discussion
The court looks to the expressed intention of the parties to determine if the contract was valid. The court uses a reasonable standard to decide whether the Plaintiff had a right to take the words as a renewal.
