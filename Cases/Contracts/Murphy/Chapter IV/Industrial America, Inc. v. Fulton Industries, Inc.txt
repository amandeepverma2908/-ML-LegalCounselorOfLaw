22 Ill.285 A.2d 412 (Del. 1971)

Brief Fact Summary
In response to an ad in the Wall Street Journal, Plaintiff, acting as the business merger broker for Bush Hog, Inc. (B-H), contacted Defendant in an attempt to broker a deal between the two companies. When B-H and Defendant decided to negotiate without the use of Plaintiff’s services, Plaintiff brought suit, seeking the recovery of his broker’s fees.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
This case stands for the proposition that an offer can be accepted by full performance.

Facts
The Plaintiff, Industrial America, Inc. (Plaintiff), through its agent, Millard B. Deutsch (Deutsch), acted as a business merger broker. Bush Hog, Inc. (B-H) informed Plaintiff that it wished to undergo a merger. Plaintiff attempted twice to negotiate an effective merger for B-H, with no success. Sometime later, the Defendant, Fulton Industries (Defendant), placed an advertisement in the Wall Street Journal, noting its intent to buy or acquire active product lines, like the one that B-H had to offer. Deutsch attempted to negotiate a meeting between Fulton and B-H, but was ousted from the negotiations and, after a successful merger, he brought suit to recover his brokers’ fees.

Issue
Was Deutsch, in opening communications between B-H and (Defendant), accepting Defendant’s offer to broker a merger?

Held
Reversed and Remanded.

Discussion
While this case, at first, appears complex, the important contract issue to remember is that an overt act toward performance can be seen as a manifestation of assent to an agreement.
