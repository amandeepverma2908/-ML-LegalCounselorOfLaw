196 Va. 493, 84 S.E.2d 516 (1954)

Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant, Zehmer (Defendant), writes a contract to sell land on a napkin and when the Plaintiff, Lucy (Plaintiff), tries to enforce it, Defendant claims he was only joking.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
If a party to the contract has a reasonable belief that the other party has the requisite intent to enter into the agreement when he does not, the contract is still enforceable.

Facts
Plaintiff’s sued the Defendant for specific performance of a contract in which the Defendant sold to Plaintiff a tract of land containing 471.6 acres for $50,000. Plaintiff and Defendant were sitting around before Christmas drinking together. They had a conversation about selling land for $50,000. The parties wrote up a contract signed by the Defendant saying they would give up the land for $50,000. Plaintiff offered $5 to ensure the bargain was binding and the Defendant refused. A waitress even testified that the Defendant said he was joking. Plaintiff went out and got his brother to put up half of the money. Plaintiff went back to Defendant and Defendant said I was only joking (Defendant claimed he told Plaintiff he was joking right after the contract was made). Defendant’s attorneys admitted that he wasn’t too drunk to make a contract.

Issue
Does a valid contract exist?

Held
Yes. Reversed.

Discussion
The court does not look to Defendants intent when making the agreement. The only focus is on the Plaintiff and if he had a reasonable belief. Here, the court is moving away from the requisite “meeting of the minds” standard, in order for there to be a valid contract.
