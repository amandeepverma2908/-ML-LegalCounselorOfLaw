A contract is assignable except when there is some reason why the non-assigning party would find performance by the other party unsatisfactory.

Facts
Defendant, a manufacturer of hair care products, made a contract with Best Barber & Beauty Supply Company, Inc. (Best Barber). Best Barber was bought by Sally Beauty Supply Company (Plaintiff), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Alberto Culver, a direct competitor of Defendant. Defendant canceled the contract with Plaintiff. Plaintiff sued Defendant. The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiff on the basis that contracts for personal services cannot be assigned.

No.
