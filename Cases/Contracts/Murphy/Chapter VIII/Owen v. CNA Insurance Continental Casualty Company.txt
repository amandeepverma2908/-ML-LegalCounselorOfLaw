22 Ill.167 N.J. 450, 771 A.2d 1208 (2001)

Brief Fact Summary
A settlement agreement was obtained between Plaintiff and Defendant, an insurance company, for a tort claim against Defendantâ€™s client. The agreement contains a non-assignment clause. Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment to declare the clause is unenforceable.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A non-assignment clause in a contract is unenforceable unless it materially changes the contract or gives the non-assigning party duties or aspect of compensation the non-assigning party did not bargain for.

Facts
Defendant is an insurance company that signed a settlement agreement with the Plaintiff. The agreement included several periodic payments. The agreement also contained a clause forbidding Plaintiff from assigning the contract. Due to an unrelated illness, Plaintiff assigned the payments to a mortgage company in exchange for a lump sum payment. Defendant refused to pay the periodic payments to the mortgage company.

Issue
Is the non-assignment clause in the structured settlement agreement enforceable?

Held
No.

Discussion
Generally, as the case provides, a contract is assignable if and only if it does not materially change the contract or put the non-assigning party in a position they did not bargain for.
