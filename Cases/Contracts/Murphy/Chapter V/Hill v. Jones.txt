22 Ill.212 So. 2d 906 (Fla. 2d DCA 1968)

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiffs, Warren Hill and Gloria Hill (Plaintiffs), entered into a contract for the purchase of a residence from the Defendants, Ora Jones and Barbara Jones (Defendants). After learning of a termite infestation, Plaintiffs brought suit, seeking rescission of the sale based on misrepresentation.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When a seller is aware of a material fact that could affect the value of property in its possession, a duty to disclose is imposed.

Facts
Plaintiffs contracted to purchase Defendantsâ€™ residence for $72,000.00. While completing the purchase, Plaintiffs questioned Defendants about termite damage, and were informed that no such damages existed. Later, Plaintiffs had a termite infestation, and learned that there had been a prior infestation on the property, and brought suit, seeking rescission of the sale, based on misrepresentation. Defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, claiming that they had no duty to disclose information pertaining to a termite infestation. The trial court granted the Motion for Summary Judgment, and Plaintiffs appealed.

Issue
The issue presented on appeal is whether the Defendants could be held to a duty to disclose to the Plaintiffs information that could materially affect the value of the property.

Held
Reversed and Remanded.

Discussion
Also note, in this case, the Defendants tried to draw a distinction between a past infestation of termites and a new infestation, contending that the fact of a past infestation was not material to Plaintiffs, once they rectified the past problems. The court focused on the materiality of the fact, saying that a material fact must be disclosed, if it is one which may affect the decision of another party.
