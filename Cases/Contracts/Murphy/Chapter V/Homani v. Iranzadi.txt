Brief Fact Summary
Ahmad Homani (Plaintiff) sued Mansoor Iranzadi (Defendant) to collect the balance due on a promissory note. Plaintiff received an amount from Defendant, which Defendant intended to pay down the principal balance but Plaintiff claimed that the payments represented interest. The trial court granted judgment for Plaintiff

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A party to a contract cannot ask the court to have his illegal objects of the contract carried out nor can he set up a case in which he must disclose an illegal purpose as the grounds of his claim.

Facts
Plaintiff and Defendant were brothers-in-law and had been involved in various business dealings together in Iran and the United States. On January 9, 1984, Plaintiff wrote a check for $250,000.00 to California Land Title to fund a real estate transaction on behalf of Defendant. The $250,000.00 loan was evidenced by two promissory notes in the amount of $125,000.00 each dated March 22, 1984. Each note provided that it was all due and payable in two years and it would bear no interest. One note was secured by property known as “Pinehill” and the other by property called “Outlook.” Defendant granted Plaintiff a power of attorney pursuant to which Plaintiff frequently wrote checks for Defendant. On March 25, 1984, Plaintiff signed a check to himself for $2,104.68 on Defendant’s account, which stated that it was for interest to March. According to the Plaintiff, this amount represented the interest lost to him by keeping the $250,000.00 accessible for two and a half months. He said

Issue
Whether a contract, which has as its object an illegal purpose is contrary to public policy and void?

Held
Yes. Judgment is reversed.

Discussion
Illegality may not prevent some contracts from being enforced if the court construes the illegality not to be serious. Some constitutionally valid statutes may provide explicitly that a particular contract is illegal and then the task of the court is rather easy.
