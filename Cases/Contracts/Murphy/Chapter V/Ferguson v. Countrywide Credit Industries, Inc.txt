22 Ill.298 F.3d 778, 89 FEP Cases 706 (9th Cir. 2002)

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff, Ferguson (Plaintiff), filed a complaint against Defendant, Countrywide Credit Industries, Inc. (Defendant), her employer, and her supervisor alleging sexual harassment, retaliation and hostile work environment.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In determining whether a contract is unconscionable one must consider whether it is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable and whether the agreement can stand without the unconscionable terms, or whether it must be stuck down in toto.

Facts
Plaintiff filed suit in District Court, alleging sexual harassment, retaliation and hostile work environment, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Defendant countered by filing a Petition to remove the action to Arbitration, based on an arbitration that was signed upon Plaintiffâ€™s employment with its firm. The District Court denied the Petition to Compel Arbitration, ruling that the agreement was unconscionable. Defendant appealed.

Issue
The issue is whether an arbitration agreement as a condition to employment is enforceable.

Held
Affirmed.

Discussion
All of the above-listed factors must be taken into consideration when making a determination of unconsionability. If an agreement is only procedurally unconscionable, it can be modified. However, if the unconscionability goes to the substance of the agreement, it will be stricken.
