22 Ill.95 B.R. 319 (E.D. Pa. 1989)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiffs brought suit against defendants, seeking to have their agreement declared unconscionable when Defendants charged Plaintiffs, who were on the verge of bankruptcy, for referring them to an attorney they could have reached for free through the local bar association.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When determining unconscionability, the court should consider whether the parties have grossly exceeded the price for their services, in comparison to other similar services.

Facts
The Plaintiffs, Fleet and others (Plaintiffs), turned to the Defendants, the United States Consumer Council, Inc. (Defendants), for help with their financial troubles. Defendants made claims that it could help people get out of debt, while it charged sometimes $195.00 to $260.00, just to refer Plaintiffs to an attorney that they could have reached for free by calling the bar association. Plaintiffs brought this action to have their agreement with the Defendant rendered unconscionable.

Issue
This case considers whether a service contract is unconscionable, based on the fact that the consumer could get the same service elsewhere for a lesser price.

Held
The fees charged by the Defendant were unconscionable.

Discussion
When a contract is found to be unconscionable on its face, a disadvantaged party is excused form performance.
