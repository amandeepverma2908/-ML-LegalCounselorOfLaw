Synopsis of Rule of Law
In order for a disclaimer of consequential damages to be valid and effective, it must be both conspicuous and conscionable.

Facts
Plaintiffs purchased a new Peterbilt truck, which had an engine made by the Defendant. It was shipped from Defendant to Peterbilt. Peterbilt subsequently installed the engine in the tractor.

Issue
Whether the disclaimer of consequential damages was conspicuous and unconscionable?

Discussion
Michigan Compiled Laws Annotated Section 440.1201 defined conspicuous as a term that is “so written that a reasonable person against whom it is to operate ought to have noticed it.” The statute explained further that a printed heading in capitals is conspicuous and language in the body is conspicuous if it is larger or contrasting type of color. Michigan Comp. Laws Ann. Section 440.2719 states that consequential damages may be excluded or limited unless it is unconscionable to do so. It is per se unconscionable if the consequential damages limitations affects a consumer good, but is not where the goods are commercial.
