22 Ill.92 Idaho 757, 450 P.2d 604 (1969)

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff, Boise Junior College District (Plaintiff), brought suit against the Defendant, Mattefs Construction Co. (Defendant) in an attempt to collect on a bid bond.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Rescission is an equitable remedy when both parties enter into a contract under a mutual mistake.

Facts
Plaintiff sought bids for a project from various construction companies. Defendant had the second-lowest bid and included in its bid was a bid bond, which offered to pay reliance damages to the Plaintiff, if Defendant turned down the job for any reason. Defendant realized a clerical error had been made when formulating the bid and sought rescission, rather than being held to the terms of the contract. The trial court found that a material mistake (i.e. a mistake that affected the essence of the contract) had been made and allowed rescission. Plaintiff appealed.

Issue
This case considers whether rescission is available when there is a mutual material mistake in the negotiation process.

Held
Affirmed.

Discussion
This is considered a mutual mistake case because the clerical error led both sides to believe they were entering into a contract that was different than it really was.
