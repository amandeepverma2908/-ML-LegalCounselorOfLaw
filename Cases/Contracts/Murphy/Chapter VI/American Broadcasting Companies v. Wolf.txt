Brief Fact Summary
Defendant is a sportscaster who was employed by Plaintiff. Defendant negotiated with another employer during the negotiation period and accepted an offer from them.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Injunctive relief is not appropriate for employment contracts that have expired. Only a negative injunctive is appropriate for employment contracts that have not expired.

Facts
Part of his contract was a three-month period when he would engage in negotiations for a new contract, followed by a period of time when he would not accept any job offer from anyone else without giving Plaintiff the opportunity to match it. If no agreement was reached, Defendant was not to accept another offer for a job as a sportscaster without presenting the offer to Plaintiff and giving Plaintiff the opportunity to match it within forty-five days.

Issue
Should Plaintiff get injunctive relief?

Held
No.

Dissent
Defendant breached the contract to negotiate in good faith. The majority’s contention that Defendant did not violate the contract to offer Plaintiff the right of first refusal makes the contract meaningless as does the court’s refusal to enforce it.

Discussion
Injunctive relief is only available negatively for contracts for personal service and then, only before the contract expires.
