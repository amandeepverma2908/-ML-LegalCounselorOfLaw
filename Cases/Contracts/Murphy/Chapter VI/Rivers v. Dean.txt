22 Ill.209 A.D.2d 936, 619 N.Y.S.2d 419 (App Div, 4th Dept 1994)

Brief Fact Summary
Defendant built an addition on Plaintiff’s house. Plaintiffs sued him because the third floor was unusable.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Cardozo’s rule, saying that damages should be the value of the structure built according to the contract minus the value of the structure as it was built is inappropriate when the defendant deviates seriously from the contract.

Facts
Defendant built an addition on Plaintiff’s house. The third floor was unusable. Plaintiff had planned to use it as a bedroom and a bathroom. Plaintiffs sued Defendant for the unworkmanlike quality of the structure. The trial court awarded damages that were the difference between the market value of the structure and the market value of the structure if the addition had been built properly.

Issue
Is Cardozo’s formula applicable here?

Held
No.

Discussion
Cardozo’s formula was founded in the case where the deviation from the contract, could be described as petty. In this, case, the problems were not petty and another formula should be used to determine damages-the market value of the work needed to set the structure to rights.
