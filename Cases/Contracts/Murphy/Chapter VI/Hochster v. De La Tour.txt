118 ER 922

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff, a currier, entered into a contract with Defendant to accompany Defendant on a trip that would begin June 1. Defendant changed his mind before June 1, and refused to compensate.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
If two parties enter into a contract to be performed at a designated time in the future, and one party refuses to perform the contract before the designated time the parties agreed to perform, the other party may sue before the contract was to be performed. That party need not wait until the time for performance has passed.

Facts
Defendant and Plaintiff entered into a contract for Plaintiff to accompany Defendant on a tour starting on June 1. Defendant contacted Plaintiff on May 11, stating that he had changed his mind. He refused to compensate Plaintiff. Plaintiff brought suit against Defendant on May 22. Plaintiff found a new job that would begin on July 1.

Issue
Was the lower court correct to find for the Plaintiff even thought the time that the contract was to be performed had not come?

Held
Yes

Discussion
The court laid down a rule about suing for damages on a breach of contract where the performance was to be at a future date. Instead of making the injured party prepare to perform when that party knows it is useless to do so, the courtâ€™s ruling allows injured parties to mitigate their damages and still sue for the damages they sustained because of the breach.
