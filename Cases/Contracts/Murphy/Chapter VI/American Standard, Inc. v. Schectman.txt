80 A.D.2d 318, 439 N.Y.S.2d 529 (App Div, 4th Dept 1981)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiffs owned a piece of property that had been a pig iron manufacturing plant. Plaintiffs agreed to convey the building structures and most of the equipment on the property to Defendant for $275,000.00. Defendant promised to remove the equipment, demolish the structures, and grade the property.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When Defendant’s nonperformance is the substantial purpose of the contract and Defendant did not substantially perform, damages shall be the cost of Defendant’s performance.

Facts
Plaintiffs own a piece of land near the Niagara River where, since the 1870s there had been a factory of some kind or another. It had several buildings as well as a blast furnace, and other industrial equipment. Plaintiff wanted to sell the land. Plaintiff agreed to convey to Defendant, a demolition and excavation contractor, all of the equipment on the land if he would remove all the equipment, demolish the structures and grade the land to a depth of one foot. Defendant did not grade the property to one foot, nor did he remove the foundations and other structures. Plaintiffs were able to sell the property for $183,000.00, which was $3000.00 below fair market value.

Issue
Should the trial court have instructed the jury that Plaintiffs damages should be calculated by subtracting the value Plaintiff’s property with Defendant’s performance from its value without Defendant’s performance?

Held
No.

Discussion
The Court pointed out that a plaintiff has the right to contract for labor that will not improve the market value of the land. In cases when the defendant did not even substantially perform, plaintiff is entitled to the cost of defendant’s performance
