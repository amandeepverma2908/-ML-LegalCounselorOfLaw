Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a contract in which Plaintiff would rent Defendant a jukebox for two years. Defendant repudiated the contract and Plaintiff never installed the jukebox.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Where there is a breach of contract to lease a piece of personal proper, supply of which is readily available, the damages should be the profits the lesser, which would have been made on the contract even if lesser is able to lease the property to someone else for the same price.

Facts
Plaintiff sued Defendant and received the profit he would have made if the contract had been performed, which was $836.00.

Issue
Should the lower court’s decision to award Plaintiff the profits Plaintiff would have made if the contract had been performed be upheld?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
This case turns on the fact that Plaintiff could buy another jukebox to lease to another customer. The court points out that in cases when the breached contract is for the sale or lease of real estate, which is unique, Defendant’s proposed formula for calculating damages would be appropriate.
