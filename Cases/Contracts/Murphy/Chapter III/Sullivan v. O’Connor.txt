199 Fed. Appx. 9

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff contracted with a physician to enhance her appearance by performing plastic surgery on her nose. After three surgeries, the physician failed to deliver the promised results and permanently disfigured the plaintiff.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Plaintiffs are entitled to recover out-of-pocket expenses for [worsening of her condition, pain and suffering and mental distress.]

Facts
The Plaintiff had three operations done on her by the Defendant in order to “enhance her beauty and improve her appearance”. After the surgeries were completed there was permanent damage which resulted in Plaintiff’s loss of employment. The jury found for the Plaintiff on contract grounds and for the Defendant on the negligence ground. The judge instructed the jury that first, the Plaintiff was entitled to her out-of pocket expenses. Second, Plaintiff could recover damages flowing directly and foreseeably from Defendants breach of promise. Third, pain and suffering from the third surgery which was done to remedy the first two, which were contracted for originally.

Issue
Should the trial court’s jury instructions be limited to expectation damages or also include reliance damages for a breach of contract involving a special arrangement between a patient/doctor?

Held
Plaintiff can recover under either the expectation or reliance theory.

Discussion
The court takes into consideration public policy by not wanting to encourage “defensive medicine” by making it easy for patients to sue for breach of promise anytime there is an incident as a result of surgery. On the other hand, the court does not want to make it so difficult to sue for breach of promise that patients can only sue for malpractice when there is an incident affecting the patient’s health due to a negligent surgeon.
