370 F. Supp. 1353 (W.D. La. 1974)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiffs, cotton farmers, entered into a contract with Defendant to sell cotton at an agreed price. The parties entered into the contracts between January and March of 1973. Between the time that the parties entered into the contracts and the time of the harvest, the price of cotton skyrocketed. Plaintiffs wish to annul the contracts.
