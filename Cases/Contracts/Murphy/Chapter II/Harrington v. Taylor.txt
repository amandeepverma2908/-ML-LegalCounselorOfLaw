39 Fed. Appx. 613

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff, Harrington (Plaintiff), saved the Defendant, Taylor (Defendant), from death or serious bodily injury. Plaintiff was promised compensation, but Defendant failed to fully comply with the promise. Plaintiff sues to enforce the original promise.<span class="heading">Synopsis of Rule of Law.</span> A humanitarian and voluntary act followed by a promise is not valid consideration.

Facts
Defendant assaulted his wife who took refuge in Plaintiff’s house. Defendant entered the house and began to assault his wife. The wife knocked Defendant down with an axe and was about to decapitate him when Plaintiff intervened and as a result her hand was badly mutilated. Consequently, Defendant promised orally to pay Plaintiff damages. Defendant paid a small sum, but refused to pay the full amount.<span class="heading">Issue.</span> If a promisee cares for, improves, or preserves the property of the promisor, though done without his request, is it sufficient consideration for the promisor’s subsequent agreement to pay for the service?

Held
No. Affirmed.

Discussion
This case illustrates the court’s differing opinions on the way a humanitarian act followed by a promise can substitute for consideration. The facts on their face are very similar to those of Webb v. McGowin, but the court arrives at a different result.
