22 Ill.232 Ala. 374, 168 So. 199 (1936)

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff, Webb (Plaintiff), in trying to save the Defendant, McGowin’s (Defendant) life, seriously injured himself. Defendant promised to pay Plaintiff a stipend for life and later ceases payment. Plaintiff sued to enforce the promise.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The material benefit rule dictates that a moral obligation is a sufficient consideration to support a subsequent promise to pay where the promisor has received a material benefit, although there was no original duty or liability resting on the promisor.

Facts
Plaintiff was clearing a floor for a lumber company and dropping pine blocks onto the floor below. As he was about to drop one block, he noticed Defendant was in the trajectory and instead, clung to the block to keep it from hitting Defendant. As a result of the fall, Plaintiff was crippled. Defendant agreed as a result, to pay Plaintiff a biweekly stipend of $15 for the remainder of Plaintiff’s life. Defendant died and now Plaintiff is suing his estate to recover the stipend since the time of Defendant’s death.

Issue
If a promisee cares for, improves, or preserves the property of the promisor, though done without his request, is it sufficient consideration for the promisor’s subsequent agreement to pay for the service?

Held
Yes. Reversed.

Discussion
The court considers the material benefit rule and finds that the saving of the defendant’s life was a material benefit. This combined with the promise to pay, results in consideration and an enforceable contract.
