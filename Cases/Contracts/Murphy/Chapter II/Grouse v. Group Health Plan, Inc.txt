22 Ill.306 N.W.2d 114, 115 LRRM 4438 (Minn. 1981)

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff, Grouse (Plaintiff), accepted Defendant, Group Health Plans’s (Defendant) job offer and then quit his current job. Defendant rescinded the offer and Plaintiff had difficulty finding a comparable job.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An illusory promise can still be enforceable where the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action on the part of the promisee and which does induce such action if injustice can be avoided only be enforcement of the promise.

Facts
Plaintiff was a pharmacist employed by Richter Drug. Plaintiff interviewed with two employees at the Defendant Corporation and was offered a job. As a result of this job offer, Plaintiff quit his current job and turned down another job offer with Veteran’s Administration Hospital. After the offer, Defendant’s manager requested references from the Plaintiff. This was the Defendant’s policy before anyone is hired. The Defendant was unable to retrieve a reference supplied by the Plaintiff and the Defendant’s manager hired someone else for the position. When Plaintiff was ready to start work, he learned the job is no longer available and he could not find comparable work elsewhere.

Issue
Does the Plaintiff have a promissory estoppel cause of action?

Held
Yes. Reversed.

Discussion
The court does not imply that an employer will be liable whenever he discharges an employee, but one has a right to assume they will be given the chance to perform their duties to the satisfaction of the employer. The line is not clear as to when an employee’s rights are being cut off by the employer.
