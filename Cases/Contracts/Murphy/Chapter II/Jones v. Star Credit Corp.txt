Synopsis of Rule of Law
Section 2-302 of the Uniform Commercial Code, (UCC) “authorizes a court to find, as a matter of law, that a contract or a clause of a contract was ‘unconscionable at the time it was made,’ and upon so finding the court may refuse to enforce the contract, excise the objectionable clause or limit the application of the clause to avoid an unconscionable result.”

Facts
Plaintiffs, who are welfare recipients, agreed to purchase a home freezer for $900. The total purchase price became $1,234.80. Thus far, the Plaintiffs have paid $619.88 towards the purchase. Defendant claims that with various charges relating to the extension of time for payment, there is a balance of $819.81 still due. The maximum retail value of the freezer is $300.

Issue
Is the transaction unconscionable pursuant to the terms of UCC Section:2-302?

Held
Yes. Public policy dictates that uneducated consumers should be protected from greedy merchants and the dangers of unequal bargaining power. UCC Section:2-302 provides for a moral sense of community in commercial transactions and if a clause of a contract is unconscionable at the time it was made, the court may refuse to enforce the contract. The UCC applies to the price term of a contract.

Discussion
The court sees UCC Section:2-302 as applying to the price term of a contract. The purpose of Section:2-302 is to protect the unequal bargaining power that is often inherent in some contractual agreements.
