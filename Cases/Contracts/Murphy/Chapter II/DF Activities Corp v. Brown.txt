22 Ill. 851 F.2d 920 (7th Cir. 1988)

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff-Appellant, DF Activities Corp. (Plaintiff), claimed they had an oral contract with the Defendant-Appellee, Brown (Defendant), to buy a chair for $60,000. The Plaintiff agrees that such a contract would be governed by the statute of frauds (SOF) and admits that the Defendant has denied the existence of the contract.
