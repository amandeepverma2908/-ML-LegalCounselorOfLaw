22 Ill.53 Md. App. 656, 456 A.2d 82 (Ct. Spec. App. 1983)

Brief Fact Summary
A corporation could not achieve its stated purpose because it was not properly structured due to the negligence of its attorney.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In the event of a breach of contract, damages for expenses incurred in reliance on the contract are recoverable, less any loss that would have resulted if the contract had been performed.

Facts
The Appellee, Hightower Productions, Ltd. (Appellee), was formed for the purpose of breaking the Guinness World Record for flagpole sitting.

It noted that this doctrine is limited in cases where the breaching party can prove that the other party would have sustained greater loss if the contract had been performed. Furthermore, while generally a breaching party is liable only for those expenses that are a foreseeable result of a breach at the time the contract was made, these limitations do not apply to an attorney when his client is relying upon his skill and knowledge. Finally, the court reasoned that the Appellant was under no duty to mitigate its damages by hiring a security specialist because this would cost a
