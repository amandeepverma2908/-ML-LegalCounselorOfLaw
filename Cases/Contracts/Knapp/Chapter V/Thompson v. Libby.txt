Synopsis of Rule of Law
The parol evidence rule prevents extrinsic evidence from being used to contradict or vary the terms of a written contract that is intended as the full expression of the parties’ agreement.

Facts

Issue
Is the evidence of the oral warranty barred by the parol evidence rule?

Held
Yes. Evidence of the warranty is inadmissible under the parol evidence rule.

Discussion
In the present case, the Court found that the evidence of a warranty was inadmissible under the parol evidence rule because it added or varied the terms of the parties written contract.
