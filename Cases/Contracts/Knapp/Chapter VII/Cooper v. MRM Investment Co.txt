22 Ill.199 F. Supp. 2d 771 (M.D. Tenn. 2002)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff, an employee of Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), brought suit against Defendant, a KFC franchisee, alleging sexual harassment.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An arbitration agreement that precludes a cause of action, thereby stripping a plaintiff of certain claims she could otherwise bring, is unconscionable.

Facts
As part of her employment contract with Defendant, Plaintiff was asked to sign a document entitled “Arbitration of Employee Rights,” which called for submission of employment-related claims to arbitration. After Plaintiff brought her sexual harassment suit in Federal Court, Defendant filed a motion to compel arbitration, seeking to have Plaintiff’s federal claims stayed until the completion of arbitration. Defendant’s main contention is that, because Plaintiff agreed to arbitration as a condition to her employment, she could not otherwise bring federal question claims against Defendant.

Issue
Does a plaintiff give up her right to bring federal claims against her employer when she signs an arbitration agreement as a condition of employment?

Held
No. The Defendants’ Motion to Compel Arbitration was denied.

Discussion
While there is a presumption in favor of arbitration agreements, a plaintiff may not be compelled to arbitrate when she can show a disparity in her position that would render the agreement unconscionable.
