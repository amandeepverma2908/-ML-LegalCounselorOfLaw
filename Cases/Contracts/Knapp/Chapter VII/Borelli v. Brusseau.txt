Dissent

Second, the dissent argues that the policy is inconsistent with modern attitudes and mores. Third, the dissenting opinion argues that spouses should be able to contract with each other in the same way as non-married persons. Fourth, the dissent makes a distinction between the duty to care for an ill spouse and the duty to personally care for an ill spouse
