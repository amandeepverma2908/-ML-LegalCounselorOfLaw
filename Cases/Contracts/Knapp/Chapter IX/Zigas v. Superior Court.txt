22 Ill.120 Cal.App.3d 827, 174 Cal.Rptr. 806 (Ct. App. 1981)

Brief Fact Summary
Tenants sued landlords for damages for charging rents in excess of those permitted by the landlords’ agreement with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

The court reasoned that the instant case is similar to Shell as the renters suffered the pecuniary loss, no governmental administrative procedure was provided for the resolution of the disputes, the parties were liable under the agreement without limitation and the contract wa
