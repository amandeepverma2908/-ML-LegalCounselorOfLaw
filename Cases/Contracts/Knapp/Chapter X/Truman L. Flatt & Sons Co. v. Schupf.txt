Brief Fact Summary
This case involves a land contract where the buyer attempted to modify the price term and when the seller rejected his proposed modification, then elected to proceed with the original terms of the contract.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A party may retract their repudiation unless the other party materially changed position in reliance on this repudiation or the other party indicates that he considers the repudiation to be final.

The court also looked to leading commentators on contract law to find that the weight of authority stood allowed a repudiating party to retract the repudiation before the aggrieved party chose to treat the contract as rescinded or before he materially changed position in reliance on the repudiation. If the aggrieved party did not change position, it must indicate to the repudiating party that it is treating the contract as rescinded. In the instant case, the court reasoned that the Defendant did not change position in that it did not sell the property to another party, nor did it even discuss selling the property to another party.
