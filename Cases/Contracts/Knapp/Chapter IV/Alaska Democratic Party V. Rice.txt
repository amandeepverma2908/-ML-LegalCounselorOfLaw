22 Ill.934 P.2d 1313, 12 IER Cases 1261 (Alaska 1997)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff Rice quit her job and relocated in reliance on a promise of employment made by Defendant, the Alaska Democratic Party. After moving to Alaska, Plaintiff was eventually informed that she did not have a job with Defendant.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A claim for promissory estoppel may be brought in an employment situation, even if the agreement is unenforceable under the statute of frauds.

Facts
Plaintiff was contacted by Defendant’s potential chair regarding a position with Defendant as executive director. After becoming Defendant’s chair, the decision to hire Plaintiff was confirmed in May, 1992. The terms were to be $36,000 a year for two years with about $4,000 in fringe benefits and an additional two years if the chair was reelected. In August, 1992, Plaintiff accepted a position working on the Gore vice-presidential campaign. A month or two later, Plaintiff accepted the job with Defendant. In November, Plaintiff resigned her position with the Gore campaign, although she could have continued there indefinitely, and moved to Alaska. No written contract was entered into between Plaintiff and Defendant.

Issue
Did the lower court err in its awards to Plaintiff on the promissory estoppel and misrepresentation claims?

Held
No. The lower court did not err in its awards based on either claim.

Discussion
Because the jury had evidence to support its verdict on both claims, the Court finds that the judgments in favor of Plaintiff were not in error. The Court rejects the argument that promissory estoppel should not apply because the agreement is unenforceable under the statute of frauds. Also, the court rejects Defendant’s arguments that the damage awards were excessive.
