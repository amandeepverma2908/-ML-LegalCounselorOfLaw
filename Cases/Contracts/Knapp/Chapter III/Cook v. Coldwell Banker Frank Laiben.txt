22 Ill.967 S.W.2d 654 (Mo. Ct. App. 1998)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff Cook was a real estate salesperson for Defendant Coldwell Banker at the time Defendant instituted a bonus program. After receiving the first part of her bonus, Plaintiff was informed that receiving the remaining portion of her bonus was contingent on continued employment. When Plaintiff left her job, Defendant refused to give her the remainder of her bonus.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An offer to enter into a unilateral contract may not be revoked once the offeree has made substantial performance.

Facts
Plaintiff worked as a real estate salesperson Defendant. In March, 1991, Defendant announced a bonus program. The bonuses started at $500 for $15,000 in commissions. For commissions from $15,000 to $25,000, an agent would receive a twenty-two percent bonus. Commissions above $25,000 would entitle the agent to a thirty percent bonus. According to the original terms of the bonus plan, bonuses over $500 were to be paid at the end of the year.

Issue
Was the unilateral contract enforceable?

Held
Yes. The unilateral contract was enforceable because Plaintiff had already made substantial performance before Defendant attempted to revoke.

Discussion
In the present case, Plaintiff substantially performed under the unilateral contract by remaining employed and earning commissions sufficient to put her in the highest tier of the bonus program prior to Defendant’s attempt to revoke. Because Plaintiff had already substantially performed, Defendant’s attempt to revoke was ineffective.
