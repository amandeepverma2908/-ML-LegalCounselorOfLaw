Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiffs Mary and Thomas Caceci brought suit against Defendant builder of their home five years after the home was constructed. Plaintiffs alleged that Defendant builders violated the implied warranty of merchantability by building on an unstable foundation which caused the kitchen floor to dip.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
New York courts recognize the Housing Merchant warranty, which imposes a contractual liability to build new homes with skillful performance and quality. Thus, the common law rule of Caveat Emptor may not be invoked in the context of new home construction.

Discussion
An implied warranty of merchantability will be read into all construction contracts for new homes. The burden for furnishing a new home without material defect will fall on the builder, and thus the builder’s actual knowledge of the defect is not necessary in order for a breach to o
