22 Ill.571 S.W.2d 640 (Ky. Ct. App. 1978)

Brief Fact Summary
Appellant Liebel, entered into a verbal dealership agreement with Appellee Raynor Manufacturing Co. The agreement did not address duration. Appellee terminated the agreement after two years.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Where there is a relationship of manufacturer-supplier and dealer-distributor, reasonable notice of intent to terminate an ongoing verbal agreement is required under the UCC.

Facts
Appellee entered into a verbal agreement to give Appellant an exclusive dealer-distributorship for Appellee’s garage doors. Appellee was to provide garage doors, operators, and parts to Appellant at the factory distributor price. Appellant agreed to sell, install and service only Appellee’s products. The agreement covered an area extending to a fifty mile radius from Lexington, Kentucky. Appellant borrowed a substantial amount of money to begin the business. After two years, sales of Appellee’s products appeared to be decreasing. Appellee notified the defendant that the relationship was terminated. In addition, Appellant learned there was a new dealer-distributor in the area and that any future purchases Appellee’s products would have to be made through the new dealer-distributor.

Issue
Was Appellant entitled to reasonable notice of Appellee’s intention to terminate the verbal agreement?

Held
Yes. Appellant was entitled to reasonable notice of Appellee’s intention to terminate the verbal agreement.

Discussion
In the present case, the Court holds that the verbal dealership agreement for infinite duration required reasonable notice of intent to terminate the agreement.
