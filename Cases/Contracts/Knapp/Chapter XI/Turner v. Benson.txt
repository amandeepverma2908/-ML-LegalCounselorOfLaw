22 Ill.672 S.W.2d 752 (Tenn. 1984)

Brief Fact Summary
This case involves a real estate contract where the buyer breached, causing the seller to incur substantial expense.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Special damages are recoverable from a breach of a real estate transaction to the extent that they directly stem from the breach and they are in reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was made.

Facts
The Plaintiffs, Robert and Anna Turner (Plaintiffs), entered into a contract to sell their residence to the Defendants, Jerry and Janice Benson (Defendants).

On the other hand, the Defendants were aware that the Plaintiffs were relying on the proceeds of their sale to finance the purchase of their new home. Therefore, all expenses stemming from the fact that the Plaintiffs were forced to own two homes at once were recoverable. The advertising costs, moving expenses, plumbing expenses, utilities, and insurance were all related to the Plaintiffs’ attempt to mitigate damages stemming from the breach. Therefor
