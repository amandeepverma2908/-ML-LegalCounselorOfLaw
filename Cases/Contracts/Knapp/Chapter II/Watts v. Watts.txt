Cohabitating parties may seek recovery following the end of the relationship under contract law, unjust enrichment, and partition.

Facts
Shortly after they met, Defendant induced Plaintiff to move in with him and quit her job. Defendant “indicated” that he would provide for Plaintiff. The parties held themselves out as husband and wife and Plaintiff took Defendant’s surname. The parties had two children, filed join tax returns, and had a joint bank account. Plaintiff was listed as Defendant’s wife on his medical insurance and life insurance policies. During their twelve year relationship, Plaintiff cared for their children and provided homemaking services. Plaintiff also contributed personal property to the relationship. Plaintiff also performed several duties for Defendant’s business and a business she started with Defendant’s sister in law. Plaintiff is no longer able to return to her business since the relationship with Defendant ended.

Issue

Held
