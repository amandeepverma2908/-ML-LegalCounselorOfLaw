Facts
Plaintiff is seeking child support from Defendant. Defendant admits he is the father of Plaintiff’s daughter, but has introduced DNA evidence that he is not the father of Plaintiff’s son. However, Defendant is listed on the birth certificate of Plaintiff’s son and Plaintiff’s son uses Defendant’s surname. In addition, Defendant established a parent-child relationship with Plaintiff’s son.<span class="heading">Issue.</span> Does Defendant have to pay child support for Plaintiff’s son?

Held
Yes. Defendant’s promise to support Plaintiff’s son is enforceable under promissory estoppel.

Dissent
The dissent does not deny that child support enforcement may be based on promissory estoppel. However, under these facts the dissent does not find detrimental reliance. The dissent argues that there is nothing preventing Plaintiff from seeking child support from the child’s biological father. With no impediment from recovery of child support, the dissent does not find detrimental reliance by Plaintiff. The dissent also notes that Defendant did not communicate with Plaintiff’s son for approximately five of the ten years and that Defendant has not supported the child for the past seven years.

Discussion
In the present case, the Court found that Defendant voluntarily promised to support a child he knew was not biologically his and Plaintiff detrimentally relied on that promise. Therefore, the Court held that the promise was enforceable under promissory estoppel.</a>
