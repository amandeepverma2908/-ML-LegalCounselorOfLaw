8 Ala. 131 (1845)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff Kirskey, was the sister-in law of Defendant Kirksey. After Plaintiff’s husband died, Defendant offered to put up Plaintiff on his land. Plaintiff gave up her land and moved to Defendant’s property, but approximately two years later Defendant made Plaintiff leave his property.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A mere gratuitous promise is without the consideration necessary for enforcement as a contract.

Facts
Plaintiff was the wife of Defendant’s brother, but was now a widow with several children. Plaintiff lived on leased public land would have attempted to secure the land had she continued to reside there. Defendant lived approximately sixty to seventy miles from Plaintiff. After hearing of his brother’s death, Defendant wrote Plaintiff and offered to provide her with land to live on if she came to see him

Issue
Is there consideration to enforce Defendant’s promise?

Held
No. Defendant’s promise was gratuitous, and as such cannot be enforced due to lack of consideration.

Discussion
The Court finds Defendant’s promise to be gratuitous and will not enforce it due to lack of consideration. It may be that the court was reluctant to interfere in a family dispute. Today, the facts presented in this case would likely be analyzed under promissory estoppel.
