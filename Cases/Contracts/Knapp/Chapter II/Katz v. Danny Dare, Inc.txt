22 Ill.610 S.W.2d 121 (Mo. Ct. App. 1980)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff Katz suffered a head injury while employed by the Defendant Danny Dare, Inc. Plaintiff was subsequently convinced to retire after being offered a pension. After retiring, Plaintiff worked for Defendant on a part time basis, but after two and a half years Defendant cut and then eliminated Plaintiff’s pension.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Promissory estoppel requires a promise, reasonable and detrimental reliance on the promise, and injustice that can only be avoided by enforcing the promise.

Facts
Plaintiff worked for Defendant from 1950 until his retirement in 1975. Plaintiff received a head injury trying to retrieve money taken from a store operated by Defendant. Plaintiff returned to work following the injury, but his walk was impaired, he had some memory loss, and did not function as he had prior to the incident. After returning to work, Plaintiff made several mistakes at considerable cost to Defendant. Defendant began attempts to induce Plaintiff to retire. Plaintiff finally agreed to retire with a pension from Defendant of $13,000 a year for life. Plaintiff testified that without the pension, he would not have retired.

Issue
Can Plaintiff enforce the promise by Defendant to pay him a pension?

Held
Yes. Plaintiff can enforce Defendant’s promise under promissory estoppel.

Discussion
Under these facts, the Court finds that Plaintiff voluntarily retired in reliance on the promise of a pension. Plaintiff did not have to show that he gave up something he had a legal right to. Instead, Plaintiff only needed to show that the elements of promissory estoppel were all present.
