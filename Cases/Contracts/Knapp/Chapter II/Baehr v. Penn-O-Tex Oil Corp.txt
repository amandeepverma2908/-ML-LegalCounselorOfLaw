22 Ill.258 Minn. 533, 104 N.W.2d 661 (1960)

Brief Fact Summary
Kemp was heavily indebted to Defendant. Defendant assisted Kemp in keeping his business going. Plaintiff sought to recover unpaid rent from Kemp. Defendant promised to pay the rent Kemp owed Plaintiff.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A promise without consideration does not create an enforceable contract.

Facts
Plaintiff leased gasoline filling stations to Kemp. Kemp was purchasing a business and related property Defendant and as a result became heavily indebted to Defendant. Because Kemp became unable to make payments due to Defendant, Kemp assigned Defendant accounts receivable and to become receivable. During this period of time, Defendant received rent paid by filling station operators and other payments made to the business sold to Kemp. At the direction of Kemp, Defendant paid some of the debts of the business. Defendant also placed an agent in the office to run the business.

Issue
Did Defendant’s promise to pay rent create an enforceable contract?

Held
No. Because there was no consideration, an enforceable contract was not created.

Discussion
In the present case, Plaintiff’s offer to delay bringing suit for unpaid rent did not create sufficient consideration to make Defendant’s promise to pay rent an enforceable contract because Defendant did not ask Plaintiff to delay bringing the suit and the delay was likely motivated by personal convenience.
