22 Ill.608 N.W.2d 20 (Iowa 2000)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff Credit Bureau Enterprises brings this action to compel Defendant Pelo to pay medical bills arising from an involuntary hospitalization. Defendant was hospitalized after he threatened to commit suicide. Initially, Defendant refused to sign a release, but later read and signed the release.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When a person is provided medical services and consent is irrelevant due to medical incompetence, that person is required to pay for the benefit received from those services.

Facts
Defendant was hospitalized under an emergency hospitalization order after threatening to commit suicide. Initially, Defendant refused to sign a release. The release makes the patient or the patient’s insurance provider liable for the hospital. According to Defendant, he was awakened at approximately 5:00 A.M. and told by a nurse that the hospital could not insure the safety and return of his person items until he signed the release. Defendant then read and signed the release. The release form stated that Defendant understood he would be liable for any portion of the hospital bill not covered by insurance. Defendant’s wife filed an application to continue his involuntary hospitalization, but Defendant was released. After his release, Defendant refused to pay or authorize his insurance provider to pay his hospital bill.

Issue
Is Defendant required to pay the hospital bill under a theory of implied contract?

Held
Yes. Defendant is obligated to pay the hospital bill.

Discussion
In the present case, the Court found that whether Defendant’s consent was voluntary was irrelevant due to his mental condition. Therefore, the Court held that Defendant is obligated to pay his hospital bill.
