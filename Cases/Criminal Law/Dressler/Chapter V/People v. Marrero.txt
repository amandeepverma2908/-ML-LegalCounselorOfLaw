Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant Marrero was charged with possession of an unlicensed loaded .38 caliber automatic pistol. As a guard at a federal prison, Defendant thought that he did not need to have the gun licensed.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Mistake of law is not a defense, except to specific intent crimes.

Facts
The Defendant was a guard at a federal prison in Connecticut. He was arrested in New York for possessing an unlicensed, loaded .38 caliber automatic pistol. Under New York Penal Law, peace officers were exempt from criminal liability under the firearm possession statute. The Defendant mistakenly believed that he qualified as a peace officer.

Issue
Is a mistake in the interpretation of a law a defense to criminal liability?

Held
No.

Dissent
Under the view that the criminal justice system punishes blameworthiness, one who does not intend to break the law should not be punished. Society has no need to exact retribution on someone who accidentally breaks the law, nor does a man not intending to break the law need to be deterred from future unlawful conduct.

Discussion
Ignorance of the law is no defense.
