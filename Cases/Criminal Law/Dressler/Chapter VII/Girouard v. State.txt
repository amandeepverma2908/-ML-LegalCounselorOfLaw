321 Md. 532, 583 A.2d 718, 1991 Md.12.

Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant, Steven S. Girouard, killed his wife, Joyce M. Girouard, after she repeatedly verbally abused him.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Words alone-that is, unaccompanied by conduct indicating a present intention and ability to cause bodily harm-cannot constitute adequate provocation to reduce murder to manslaughter.

Facts
The Defendant and the victim were married. After the Defendant overheard the victim telling a friend that her husband did not love her anymore, the Defendant confronted her and kicked over her plate of food she had in front of her. The Defendant then went to lie down in the bedroom. The victim followed him into the bedroom, stepped onto his back, pulled his hair, and said, “What are you going to do, hit me?” She thereafter continued to taunt and insult him. After she was through, the Defendant went to the kitchen to procure a long handled kitchen knife. He concealed it behind a pillow and returned to the bedroom. After more insults, including that she did not love him and that the marriage was a mistake, the Defendant lunged at the victim with the knife and stabbed her 19 times. Then, the Defendant attempted to commit suicide, but when he realized he would not die from his self-inflicted wounds, he called the police, who found him wandering around outside his apartment buildin

Issue
Can words alone constitute adequate provocation to justify a conviction of manslaughter rather than murder?

Held
