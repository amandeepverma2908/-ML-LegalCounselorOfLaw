Brief Fact Summary
The Defendants, husband and wife, were convicted for manslaughter for failure to seek medical treatment for the wife’s infant son.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A person is guilty of statutory manslaughter if the death of a dependent minor child is caused by a failure to exercise “ordinary caution” in obtaining medical care.

Facts
The Defendant husband, Walter Williams, was married to the Defendant wife, Bernice Williams. The defendant wife had two children to a previous relationship, the younger of the two, William Joseph Tabafunda, was the victim here. Both Defendants became aware that William was ill during the period September 1, 1968 to September 12, 1968, but they did not realize how sick he really was. They thought that he had a toothache, an affliction that certainly does not seem to be dangerous to life. They gave the baby aspirin but did not take him to a doctor for fear that the welfare department would take the baby away. The Defendants knew that medical help was available because of prior experience. William died after about two weeks.

Issue
Do the findings support the conclusion that the Defendants are guilty of manslaughter?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
A parent must exercise “ordinary caution” in seeking medical treatment for a dependent minor child.
