Brief Fact Summary
Defendant Berry was charged with second-degree murder after his dog killed the child of his neighbors.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Second-degree murder based on an unintentional killing requires an extreme indifference to the value of human life and an awareness either of the risks of the conduct or that the conduct is contrary to law.

Facts
The Defendant lived next door to the Soto family, and they shared a driveway. The Soto family consisted of parents Arthur Soto and Yvonne Nunez and four young children. Among them was the victim, James Soto, age two years and eight months. The Defendant owned a pit bull named “Willy” that he kept tethered in his yard with no other barrier preventing access to him. On the date in question, the victim wandered away from his mother and into the Defendant’s yard. Willy subsequently attacked and killed the victim. There was no evidence that Willy had ever attacked a person before, but there was substantial evidence that he had been trained as a fighting dog.

Issue
Is the evidence sufficient to bind the Defendant over on the murder charge?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
A person is guilty of second-degree murder upon proof of an unintentional killing where he evidences an extreme indifference to the value of human life, and his conduct is illegal or he knew it to be dangerous.
