33 Cal.2d 80, 199 P.2d 1 (1948)

Brief Fact Summary
Charles A. Summers (Plaintiff) was struck in the eye and lip by shots from one or both of Defendants’ guns. There was no way to determine whose bullet struck the Plaintiff. The trial court held that both Defendants were liable to Plaintiff.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
If two defendants cause damage that either one would be liable for, then both defendants will be held liable if it cannot be easily determined which defendant was the cause in fact of the injury.

Facts
Plaintiff, Ernest Simonson, and Harold W. Tice were hunting in the same area. At the same time, both defendants negligently fired their guns at a quail, and in the direction of Plaintiff. Plaintiff was struck in the eye and lip by shots from one or both of Defendants’ guns. There was no way to determine whether the shots were from the gun of one defendant or the other or one shot from each of them. The shot that entered Plaintiff’s eye did the most damage, and that shot could not have come from both of the Defendants. However, the trial court held that both Defendants were liable. Defendants appealed on the grounds that they were not joint tortfeasors, they were not acting in concert and there was insufficient evidence to show which of them was negligent.

Issue
Are both Defendants liable for shooting Plaintiff when it cannot be determined which gun or guns fired the shots that injured Plaintiff?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
In this case, the court imposes liability on Defendants without determining which Defendant is the cause in fact of Plaintiff’s injury. The test in this case is referred to as the alternative causation test.
