Synopsis of Rule of Law
Every person is liable for the consequences of his own acts. He is liable for damages for the proximate results of his own acts, but not for remote damages.

Facts
Defendant owned a woodshed, which was set on fire either by carelessness or by a defect in one of its engines. Plaintiff’s house was 130 feet from the shed. It was consumed in the fire despite diligent efforts to save it. Plaintiff sued Defendant. Defendant moved for a nonsuit, which was granted. The nonsuit was affirmed. Plaintiff appealed.

Issue
Is Defendant liable to Plaintiff for the damages sustained to Plaintiff’s house in a fire, which originated from Defendant’s woodshed?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
The terms, proximate cause and remote cause, set boundaries for how far the court is willing to extent liability. Proximate causes and remote causes are causes in fact of the injury or damage sustained. However, the court is not willing to grant relief for a remote cause, only a proximate cause. A remote cause will essentially limit a plaintiff’s ability to collect from a defendant who caused him damage. Remote causes are not recoverable because they are far removed from the scene, link, or causal connection.
