Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant Oxendine, Sr., was convicted by jury of manslaughter for the death of his son, Jeffrey Oxendine, Jr., whom the Defendant had beaten or kicked in the abdomen. The Defendant was convicted of manslaughter, and he argued on appeal that since the Defendant’s girlfriend had already delivered a fatal blow to the victim, he did not actually cause the victim’s death.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Contribution to or aggravation of death without acceleration of death is insufficient to establish the causation of death required for a conviction of manslaughter.

The Defendant, believing the victim to be exaggerating, went out to buy a newspaper and returned home to read it. When he returned, Tyr

Issue
Did the Defendant’s conduct hasten death, thereby being deemed to have caused death?

Held
No.
