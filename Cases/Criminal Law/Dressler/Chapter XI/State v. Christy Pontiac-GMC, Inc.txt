Brief Fact Summary
In a bench trial, the Defendant Christy Pontiac-GMC, Inc. (Defendant) was found guilty of two counts of theft by swindle and two counts of aggravated forgery and was sentenced to a $1,000 fine on each of the two forgery convictions. The Defendant argues that, as a corporation, it cannot be prosecuted for theft or forgery and that the evidence failed to establish that the acts complained of were the acts of the Defendant.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
