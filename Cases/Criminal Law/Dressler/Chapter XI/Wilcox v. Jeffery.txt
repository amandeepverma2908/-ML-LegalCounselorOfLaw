Brief Fact Summary
Herbert Wilcox (Wilcox), the proprietor of Jazz Illustrated, was charged with aiding and abetting Coleman Hawkins (Hawkins) in contravention of the Aliens Order of 1920, by failing to comply with a condition stating that Hawkins shall take no employment, paid or unpaid, while in the United Kingdom and shall not land in the country without the leave of an immigration officer.
