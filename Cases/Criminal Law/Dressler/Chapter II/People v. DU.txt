Brief Fact Summary
Judge Karlin sentenced the Defendant, Du (Defendant), to ten years in state prison, but then suspended the sentence and placed her on probation. The portion of the case provided by the Dressler handbook includes the judge’s remarks at sentencing.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In imposing a sentence, a judge must first consider the objectives of sentencing a defendant, including: (1) to protect society; (2) to punish the defendant for committing a crime; (3) to encourage the defendant to lead a law-abiding life; (4) to deter others; (5) to isolate the defendant so she cannot commit other crimes; (6) to secure restitution for the victim and (7) to seek uniformity in sentencing.

Facts
The Defendant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter following the shooting of fifteen year old Latasha Harlins (Harlins) after an altercation in a convenience store owned by the Defendant’s family. The gun that the Defendant used to shoot Harlins with had previously been altered without the Defendant’s knowledge. Further, the Defendant had decided to work that particular shift at the convenience store in order to allow her son to work at another store that the family owned. The Defendant made this decision because her son had previously been the victim of threats by local gang members.
