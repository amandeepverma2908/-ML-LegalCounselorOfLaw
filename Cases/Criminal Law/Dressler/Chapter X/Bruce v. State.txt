Synopsis of Rule of Law
Attempted felony murder is not a crime in Maryland.

Facts
The Defendant and two men entered the victim’s shoe store masked and armed with a handgun. The victim was ordered to open the cash register. Finding it empty, the Defendant aimed the gun at the victim’s face. The Defendant threatened to kill the victim. The victim tried to get out of the way and while the circumstances are not exactly clear, the Defendant shot the victim in the stomach. The Defendant was charged with attempted felony murder.

Issue
Is attempted felony murder a crime in Maryland?

Held
No. A conviction for felony murder requires no specific intent to kill. A criminal attempt requires a specific intent to commit the offense, coupled with a substantial step toward committing the offense beyond mere preparation. Hence, since attempt requires a specific intent to commit the offense, but felony murder requires no specific intent to kill, attempted felony murder cannot be a crime.

Discussion
Attempted felony murder cannot be a crime since felony murder does not require a specific intent to kill. In other words, one cannot attempt to commit a crime he or she does not intend to commit.
