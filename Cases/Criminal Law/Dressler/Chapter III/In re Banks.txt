Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant is challenging the North Carolina “Peeping Tom” statute as unconstitutional.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A criminal statute must be sufficiently definite to give notice of the act proscribed.

Facts
The North Carolina “Peeping Tom” statute provides, “Any person who shall peep secretly into any room occupied by a female person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be fined or imprisoned in the discretion of the court.” The Defendant challenges the constitutionality of this statute, averring that it is vague because it does not inform men of common intelligence of its meaning and application.

Issue
Is the North Carolina “Peeping Tom” statute unconstitutionally vague?

Held
No.

Discussion
In order to pass constitutional muster, a statute must inform the general public, in the simplest terms possible, of acts constituting a crime. A statute does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Constitution if it fairly alerts an individual as to what conduct is prohibited.
