Brief Fact Summary
After abusing her, Defendant’s wife obtained an order of protection against him which specified he had to stay away from her and move out of the home.

Once they arrived, the friend left and Defendant forced Denise to have sexual intercourse with him. He also forced his son to watch the non-consensual intercourse.
