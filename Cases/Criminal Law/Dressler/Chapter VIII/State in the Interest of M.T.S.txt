129 N.J. 422, 609 A.2d 1266, 1992 N.J. 420,

Brief Fact Summary
Defendant was charged with sexual assault after having engaged in sexual penetration of a girl with whom he was engaged in consensual kissing and heavy petting but whom had not consented to penetration. There was no evidence that Defendant used force other than that normally used to effect penetration.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Any act of sexual penetration engaged in without the affirmative and freely given permission of the victim to the specific act of penetration constitutes sexual assault.

Facts
Defendant, a seventeen-year-old boy, was engaged in consensual kissing and heavy petting with the alleged victim and during the encounter penetrated the girl without her consent. There was no evidence that Defendant used any extra force or threats in order to penetrate the alleged victim. However, the trial court found Defendant guilty of sexual assault. The Appellate division reversed on the ground that non-consensual penetration, absent the use of more force that that necessary to accomplish penetration, does not constitute sexual assault. The New Jersey Supreme Court grated the Stateâ€™s petition for certification.

Issue
With regard to the crime of rape, is the element in rape of physical force met simply by an act of non-consensual penetration involving no more force than necessary to accomplish that act?

Held
Yes. Judgment of the Appellate Division reversed.

Discussion
This case brings up the policy issue of whether or not extrinsic force should be a required in proving rape.
