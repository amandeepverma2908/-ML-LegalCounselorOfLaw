Brief Fact Summary
Fischer (D) was convicted of raping a fellow college student with whom, hours before the alleged rape, he had had a consensual sexual encounter. D argued at trial that in light of the previous encounter, he reasonably believed that his actions during the second encounter were consensual. D appeals on the basis that the trial counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to request that the jury be instructed on a mistake of fact defense.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
This court refuses to create a mistake of fact defense to the crime of rape.

Facts
Fischer (D) was convicted of raping a fellow college student with whom, hours before the alleged rape, he had had a consensual sexual encounter. D argued at trial that in light of the previous encounter, he reasonably believed that his actions during the second encounter were consensual. D was convicted and subsequently retained new counsel, advancing the argument on appeal that the trial counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to request that the jury be instructed that if it found that the appellant reasonably believed that the victim consented to his advances that it could find D not guilty.

Issue
Had the trial counsel requested a jury instruction allowing for a mistake of fact defense, would such a request have been successful? In other words, is mistake of fact a viable defense in the case of rape?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
This case illustrates the courtâ€™s reluctance to allow a mistake of fact defense in the case of rape.
