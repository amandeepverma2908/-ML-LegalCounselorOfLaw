129 Wis. 2d 239,385 N.W.2d 145, 1986 Wisc.

Brief Fact Summary
Appellee was charged with child abuse for failing to prevent future acts of abuse by her husband whom she knew to be abusing their two kids. The State appealed a dismissal of the charges.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A parent has a duty to act when the parent knowingly acts in disregard of the facts giving rise to the duty to act or protect their child.

Held
A parent who fails to take any action to stop child abuse can be prosecuted as a principal under the statute.
