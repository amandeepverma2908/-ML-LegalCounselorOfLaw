416 F. Supp. 496,1976 U.S. Dist..

Brief Fact Summary
Defendant, who was highly praised in the community, was charged with fraud.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
General Deterrence is a legitimate justification for imprisonment.

Facts
Defendant Bergman, a doctor of divinity and an ordained rabbi was acclaimed by people around the world for his works of public philanthropy, private charity, and leadership in educational enterprises. In addition to his good works, Defendant amassed considerable wealth in the ownership and operation of nursing homes, real estate ventures, and other investments.

Issue
Is Defendant’s incarceration legally justified?

Held
Yes, defendant sentenced to a term of four months in prison.

Discussion
General deterrence is a legitimate purpose of imprisonment. The aim of general deterrence is to discourage similar wrongdoing by others through a reminder that the law’s warnings are real that the grim consequence of imprisonment is likely to follow from crimes of deception for gain like those Defendant committed. There is also a concern that a lesser penalty would depreciate the seriousness of the Defendant’s crime.
