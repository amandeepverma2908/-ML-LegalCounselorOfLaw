305 Minn. 226,232 N.W.2d 798, 1975 Minn.

Brief Fact Summary
Defendant conspired with his cousin who was working with the police to kill Defendant’s mother. Defendant appeals a conviction for conspiracy and attempted murder.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
If the individual not feigning acquiescence has conspired within the meaning of the statute in the belief that the other party was with him, his culpability is not decreased by the other’s secret intention.

Facts
Defendant contacted his cousin to ask for help in his plan to kill his mother. The cousin testified for the prosecution and said that at no time did he plan to help Defendant. The cousin contacted the police who told him to continue to discuss the plan with the Defendant. On the day Defendant wanted his cousin to kill Defendant’s mother, the police arrested Defendant. Defendant was charged with conspiracy to commit murder, attempted murder. Defendant contends on appeal that he was the only willing party to the conspiracy and thus he could not be guilty of conspiracy as well as the attempted murder charge.

Issue
Whether the statute requires a meeting of the minds or in other words, two willing conspirators to support a conviction of conspiracy.

Held
Affirmed as the conviction for conspiracy and reversed as to the conviction of attempted first degree murder.

Discussion
The Court ruled that the plain language of Minnesota’s statute on conspiracy allowed the court to discard old precedent requiring a meeting of the minds for a conspiracy conviction to be supported. The Court noted that criticism had been advanced regarding this requirement because it would allow individual who had a culpable mental state to be acquitted because the other party to the conspiracy was not truly agreeing to commit the crime agreed upon.
