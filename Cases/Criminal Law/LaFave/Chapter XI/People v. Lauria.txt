251 Cal. App. 2d 471,59 Cal. Rptr. 628, 1967 Cal. App.

Brief Fact Summary
Defendant knew that prostitutes used her answering service and yet allowed them to do so. Defendant was acquitted of the conspiracy charge to commit prostitution and the State appealed.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The intent of a supplier who knows of the criminal use to which his supplies are put to participate in the criminal activity connected with the use of his supplies may be established by direct evidence or through an inference that he intends to participate based on his special interest in the activity or aggravated nature of the crime itself.

Facts
Defendant was charged with conspiracy to commit prostitution. The State alleged that Defendant offered an answering service for the others to use for their call girl activity. The trial court set aside the indictment as having been brought without reasonable or probable cause. The State timely appealed.

Issue
Under what circumstances does a supplier become a part of a conspiracy to further an illegal enterprise by furnishing goods or services which he knows are to be used by the buyer for criminal purposes?

Held
The order is affirmed.

Discussion
The Court commenced the ruling by noting that there was a split on whether a supplier could be convicted of the conspiracy for which his goods were being used to further. The Court found no proof that Defendant took any direct action to further, encourage or direct the prostitution activities. The Court noted that aggravated crimes such as felonies would make this even remote participate enough to sustain a conviction for conspiracy. However the court noted that Defendant ran a legitimate business and because of the nature of the crime and lack of incentive to Defendant in allowing the others to use her answering service, she was not guilty of conspiracy.
