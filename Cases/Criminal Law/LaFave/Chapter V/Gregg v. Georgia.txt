Synopsis of Rule of Law

Appellant was found guilty of two counts of armed robbery and two counts of murder. The jury returned a verdict with a sentence of death on all counts. The Georgia State Supreme Court vacated the death sentences for armed robbery. Appellant argued that Furman v. Georgia made the imposition of the death penalty unconstitutional per se.

Whether the death penalty is unconstitutional per se as in violation of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.

Held
Affirmed, the punishment of death is no always in violation of the Constitution.

Justice Brennan dissented, arguing that death like the punishment of being ‘on the rack’ were no longer morally tolerable.

Georgia, 35 states enacted legislation designating specific offenses as punishable by death. The Court noted that citizens, through their state legislatures accepted capital punishment as an appropriate punishment. The Court noted that Georgia had instituted several safe-guards to ensure that the death penalty was properly applied which included mandatory higher court review and relaxation on evidence standards regarding what evidence the defense can prod
