514 F.2d 570,1975 U.S. App.

Brief Fact Summary
Appellant was charged with a crime against nature for forcibly committing cunnilingus on a female victim.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Cunnilingus is not within the scope of Tennessee’s “crimes against nature” statute.

Facts
Appellant Locke was charged and convicted of committing a “crime against nature” when he entered the apartment of neighbor and forced her into two episodes of cunnilingus. The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction in Locke v. State, rejecting Appellant’s claim that the “crimes against nature” statute was unconstitutionally vague. Appellant then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the district court. That court rejected the Appellant’s claim and Appellant timely appealed.

Issue
In light of prior state court opinions, is cunnilingus within the scope of Tennessee’s “crimes against nature” statute?

Held
No, the judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case remanded to the district court.

Discussion
The Court reasons that past case law has differed in its definitions of “crimes against nature” so that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess as to whether it includes cunnilingus.
