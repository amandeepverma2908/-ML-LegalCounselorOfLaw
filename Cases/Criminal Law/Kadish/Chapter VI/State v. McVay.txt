Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant, McVay (Defendant), was charged as accessory before the fact in a larger manslaughter prosecution arising out of an explosion that occurred on a Newport-bound steamer which killed several passengers.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A defendant may be charged as accessory before the fact even in manslaughter crimes where the resulting harm is not intentional.

Facts
The Defendant counseled the captain and engineer of a steamer to continue transporting passengers even though he knew that the boiler on the steamer was unsafe. On the way to Newport, the boiler exploded and several passengers were killed as a result.

Issue
Can a defendant be held liable as accessory before the fact in a manslaughter prosecution where the resulting harm was unintentional?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
The court in this case holds that a defendant may be an accessory before the fact in a crime he has no intention of ever committing. The court reasoned that one could still be involved in the “planning” of an unintentional crime insomuch as one’s own negligence in failing to take charge of a duty was a volitional act with foreseeable harmful consequences.
