Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant, Hayes (Defendant), was convicted of burglarizing a general store. The Defendant’s accomplice in the burglary, a relative of the store owners, only participated so that the Defendant could be caught in the act and had no actual intent to rob the store.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The actions of one accomplice cannot be imputed, for purposes of criminal liability, to another accomplice if the original accomplice is merely feigning cooperation and lacks the requisite intent to commit a crime.

Facts
The Defendant and another individual agreed to rob a general store together. Unbeknownst to the Defendant, his accomplice was actually a relative of the store owners who was merely going along in order to catch the Defendant in the act of robbing the store. At the store, the Defendant opened a window and assisted his accomplice in gaining entrance to the building. Shortly thereafter, the two were apprehended.

Issue
Are the actions of the Defendant’s accomplice in entering the building imputable to the Defendant himself under the theory of accomplice liability?

Held
No. Judgment reversed.

Discussion
This case illustrates the principle in accomplice liability that the unlawful acts of one defendant are imputable to another only where there is a “common motive and a common design.” Here, the Defendant and his accomplice did not have the same intent in entering the building and were therefore not accomplices for purposes of accomplice liability.
