22 Ill.517 U.S. 1127, 116 S. Ct. 1368, 134 L. Ed. 2d 533 (1996)

Brief Fact Summary
Appellant was convicted of petty larceny. The court considers whether based on the facts, the conviction can be sustained.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A person who obtains property via consent of its owner through trick or fraud is guilty of larceny because the trick or fraud vitiates the transaction and the owner is deemed to retain constructive possession.

Facts
Appellant, Hufstetler drove his car up to the gasoline tanks located at the complaining witnessâ€™s gas service station. There were two or three other men in the car, and a man in the back seat got out and came into the store asking if there was a telephone. When the owner told him there was no phone in the service station, the man said he wanted his gas tank filled. The owner put approximately six gallons of gas in the car and then the man asked for a quart of oil. When the owner went to retrieve the oil, the defendant and the other men drove off without paying for the gasoline. Appellant was subsequently convicted of petty larceny.

Issue
Can the appellant be guilty of larceny when the owner of the service station voluntarily parted with the possession and ownership of the gasoline?

Held
Yes. Affirmed and remanded for proper sentence.

Discussion
The obtaining of property by the consent of the owner under these fraudulent conditions is considered larceny. In other words, an actual physical trespass or interference with property is not always required to be proven.
