22 Ill.739 F.2d 945 (4th Cir. 1984)

Brief Fact Summary
Defendant Fleming was charged and convicted of second-degree murder for killing someone while driving under the influence of alcohol. Defendant, on appeal, maintains that the facts are inadequate to establish the malice element of murder and that he therefore should only have been charged with manslaughter.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Malice can be established by evidence that Defendant acted recklessly; it does not require proof that the defendant acted with ill will.

Facts
Defendant was driving with excessive speed while drunk and lost control of his car, killing Margaret Haley as a result. Defendant was convicted of second-degree murder which requires a showing of malice on the part of Defendant and timely appeals, arguing that the facts are inadequate to establish malice and therefore he should have been convicted of manslaughter at the most.

Issue
Does malice require evidence that the defendant acted with ill will toward the victim?

Held
No. Conviction affirmed.

Discussion
This case raises the issue once again of what the difference is between murder and manslaughter and the difficulty inherent in such line drawing. The viewpoint taken by the court in United States v. Fleming is different than that of the Model Penal Code which maintains that inadvertent risk creation such as drunk driving cannot be punished as murder.
