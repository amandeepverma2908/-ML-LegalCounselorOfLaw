Brief Fact Summary
Defendant Malone was convicted of murder for killing his friend while playing Russian roulette. Defendant argued that he did not intend to harm the victim and therefore the facts do not justify a conviction of murder.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Malice, the state of mind required for murder, is evidenced where an individual performs an uncalled for act in disregard of its likely harmful effects on another even where the harmful result is not intended.

Facts
Defendant was convicted of second-degree murder for killing his friend while playing Russian roulette. Defendant testified that he had loaded the gun chamber directly to the right of the firing chamber and that when he pulled the trigger he did not expect the gun to go off. He claimed that he did not intend to harm the victim and on appeal, argues that therefore the facts do not justify a conviction of murder but only manslaughter.

Issue
Can recklessness satisfy the state of mind required to uphold a conviction of manslaughter?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
This case introduces the line drawing that courts must engage in to distinguish between murder and manslaughter with regard to unintentional killings.
