Brief Fact Summary
Defendant was convicted of second-degree murder for having ended a verbal domestic fight with his wife by stabbing her nineteen times. Defendant appeals, arguing that he was adequately provoked by his Wife’s words such that the provocation should mitigate the conviction to manslaughter.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Words alone are not adequate provocation to reduce a second- degree murder charge to voluntary manslaughter.

Facts

Issue
Are words alone adequate provocation to reduce a second degree murder charge to voluntary manslaughter?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
