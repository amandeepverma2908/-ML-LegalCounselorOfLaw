2 Cal.3d 619, 87 Cal.Rptr. 481, 470 P.2d 617 (1970)

Brief Fact Summary
Petitioner Keeler was charged with murder and appeals the denial of his motion to set aside the information on the ground that a fetus is not a “human being”, as contemplated by the California law defining murder.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The term “human being”, as contemplated by the penal code of California, does not include an unborn fetus.

Facts
Petitioner intercepted his ex-wife, who was in the advanced state of pregnancy, and shoved his knee into her abdomen following his exclamation that he was going to stomp the fetus out of her. As a result, the fetus was delivered stillborn with a fractured skull. Petitioner was charged with murder of the fetus under California’s Penal Code which provides that “murder is the unlawful killing of a human being, with malice aforethought”. Petitioner moved to set aside the charge based on his contention that a fetus is not a human being as contemplated by the murder statute. The motion was denied and the petitioner seeds a writ of prohibition.

Issue
Does the fetus which Petitioner is accused of killing constitute a human being within the meaning of the statute?

Held
No. Writ of prohibition granted.

Dissent
The dissent suggests that the words of a statute must be interpreted by the courts to promote justice and should not be frozen in time.

Discussion
This case addresses several aspects of legality and their limitations with regard to criminal law such as the fact that we do not allow judge-made law, however, laws are written in general terms which necessitates interpretation. The case also addresses the idea that we do not allow the imposition of retroactive lawmaking and that we must afford notice of what acts constitute criminal behavior such that individuals have the opportunity to avoid such behavior.
