22 Ill.319 Mo. 1222, 6 S.W.2d 609 (1928)

Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant, Davis (Defendant), was convicted of attempted murder for hiring someone to kill another man so that he could collect the insurance money. The man he hired to do the killing was actually an undercover police officer who never intended to carry out the crime.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Mere acts of preparation, failing to lead directly or proximately to the completion of a crime, cannot sustain a conviction for an “attempt” crime.

Facts
The Defendant paid another individual – whom he did not know was an undercover police officer – $600 to carry out his plans for killing someone. The Defendant devised scheme for the other individual to appear at this person’s home, kill him and then feign a robbery. At the appointed time for the robbery, the undercover officer went to the intended crime scene, informed the persons there of his real identity, then went back to the Defendant’s home and arrested the Defendant.

Issue
Did the Defendant commit attempted murder by unknowingly hiring as a “hit man” an undercover police officer who never had any intention of carrying out the crime.

Held
No. Judgment reversed.

Discussion
This case illustrates “attempt” jurisprudence in relation to solicitation. Here, the court held that the solicitation by the Defendant of another person to commit murder was not itself an act constituting a substantial step toward the completion of a crime.
