Facts
Maryland State Firemen’s Association, Plaintiff, sued Chaves, Defendant. Plaintiff mailed Defendant the summons by first class mail to an address from Defendant’s letterhead. Defendant did not respond to the complaint and Plaintiff filed motion for judgment by default. The clerk entered the default against Defendant. The court sent Plaintiff a request to explain why they believed service was effective.

Issue
Is service of process effective under Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if the plaintiff mails the defendant the complaint and summons via first class mail and the defendant has actual notice of the lawsuit?

Held
No. Judgment of default vacated.

Discussion
The mechanics of serving process under Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are very strict. As the court illustrates, service is not effective if the complaint is mailed via first class mail. The plaintiff must attempt to have the defendant waive service or accept personal service. Only then should service by mail be attempted.
