22 Ill.383 U.S. 715, 86 S. Ct. 1130, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218, 61 LRRM 2561 (1966)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff sued Defendant, asserting claims under both the Labor Management Relations Act and various provisions of state law. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Plaintiff on the federal and state law claims. The trial court reversed the jury’s verdicts but upheld a remitted award on the state law claims to which Defendant appealed.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, if the federal claim and the state claim arise from the same “case or controversy,” the federal court can exercise jurisdiction over the state claim as well. If the federal and state claims arise from a “common nucleus of operative fact,” then they comprise the same case or controversy. The court should not exercise jurisdiction if there would be high risk of jury confusion, the federal claims are dismissed, or it would otherwise preserve judicial expenses.

Facts
Tennessee Consolidated Coal Company hired Gibbs, Plaintiff, to be a mine superintendent and to haul coal from one of the company’s mines. When Plaintiff went to the mine, members of United Mine Workers of America (a rival union of the current mine workers’ union) blocked the mine and beat up Plaintiff. Plaintiff was then fired and never started the haulage contract. Plaintiff also lost other mining and trucking contracts after the incident. Plaintiff sued the union, alleging that the loss of his jobs was part of a union conspiracy, which was unlawful under Section 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. Plaintiff also asserted a state law claim, which was granted jurisdiction based on the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction. The jury returned a verdict for Plaintiff. Damages recovered were the amount of the employment contract and the haulage contract, plus punitive damages. The trial court set aside the damages relating to the haulage contract (because damages were no

Issue

Held
Yes. Judgment reversed.
