Brief Fact Summary
The jury in a wrongful death action submitted a general verdict accompanied by interrogatories. The Plaintiffs, the Nollenberger family (Plaintiffs), alleged that the interrogatory answers were inconsistent with the general verdict and requested the court to either (i) submit additional interrogatories to the jury; or (ii) calculate the verdict on the answers given or (iii) grant a new trial.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When special interrogatories are inconsistent with the general verdict, the special interrogatories control.

Facts
The Plaintiffs brought a wrongful death claim against the Defendants, United Air Lines, Inc. (Defendants), in which the jury had entered a general verdict accompanied by special interrogatories. The jury’s answers to the interrogatories, the Plaintiffs’ claimed, were inconsistent with the general verdict. The Plaintiffs asked the Court to either (i) submit additional interrogatories to the jury; (ii) calculate the verdict on the basis of the answers given to the questions or (iii) grant a new trial.

Issue
Whether the findings of fact in the answers given by the jury to the special interrogatories were consistent with each other and whether one or more, if consistent with each other, were inconsistent with the general verdict fixing the total sum of damages to the Plaintiffs resulting from the death of the decedent.

Held
The jury’s findings of fact in the special interrogatories control over the general verdict.

Discussion
There are multiple forms of verdicts in which the jury renders its decision.
