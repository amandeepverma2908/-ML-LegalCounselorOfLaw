Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Seventh Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution) does apply to actions enforcing statutory rights and requires a jury trial upon demand if the statute creates legal rights and remedies enforceable in an action for damages in the ordinary courts of law.

Facts
Petitioner brought a suit against Respondents for their alleged discrimination in refusing to rent an apartment to her because of her race. Petitionerâ€™s complaint sought injunctive relief and punitive damages and was later amended to include compensatory damages. The injunctive relief was granted and then dissolved when Petitioner had obtained other housing. The trial commenced on the issues of actual and punitive damages. Respondents made a timely request for a jury trial and the District Court denied the request. The Petitioner was awarded $250 in punitive damages. On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed on the jury trial issue.
