Citation
22 Ill.174 Kan. 357, 255 P.2d 658 (1953)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff recovered from its insurance company based on a claim for damage due to Defendant’s negligence. Plaintiff then sued Defendant for negligence and for recovery for Defendant’s damage on behalf of the insurer. Defendant moved to dismiss on the grounds that because Plaintiff had already been paid, it was not the real party in interest and could not sue Defendant.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Only a party that is directly interested in the subject matter of the litigation may bring suit against another party.

Facts
Plaintiff Ellis Canning Company was insured by its insurance company under a policy containing a subrogation clause. Plaintiff alleged that Defendant International Harvester Company negligently started a fire and damaged Plaintiff’s tractor that was insured under the policy. Plaintiff recovered for the loss under the policy from its own insurance company. Plaintiff then sued Defendant on behalf of the insurer alleging negligence. Defendant denied the allegations and moved to dismiss on the grounds that Plaintiff was not a real party in interest. The trial court dismissed the case.

Issue
Can Plaintiff maintain an action against Defendant for the benefit of its insurer even though Plaintiff has already been reimbursed for the loss?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
The court focuses on whether Plaintiff is pursuing a claim on its behalf or for a third party, not on the allegations against Defendant, to determine whether Plaintiff is a real party in interest.
