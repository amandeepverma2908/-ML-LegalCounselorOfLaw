Brief Fact Summary
An individual murdered his ex-landlord with a knife.  While awaiting trial in jail, he asked an officer for his civilian clothing, but instead was required to wear his prison issued clothing during trial.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
“[A]lthough the State cannot, consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment, compel an accused to stand trial before a jury while dressed in identifiable prison clothes, the failure to make an objection to the court as to being tried in such clothes, for whatever reason, is sufficient to negate the presence of compulsion necessary to establish a constitutional violation.”

Facts
The Respondent, Williams (the “Respondent”), was convicted in state court for assault with intent to commit murder with malice.  The Respondent went back to an apartment complex he used to live in and got into an altercation with his ex-landlord.  The Respondent eventually stabbed the landlord.

Issue
“[W]hether an accused who is compelled to wear identifiable prison clothing at his trial by a jury is denied due process or equal protection of the laws?”

Held
“The potential effects of presenting an accused before the jury in prison attire need not, however, be measured in the abstract. Courts have, with few exceptions, determined that an accused should not be compelled to go to trial in prison or jail clothing because of the possible impairment of the presumption so basic to the adversary system. This is a recognition that the constant reminder of the accused’s condition implicit in such distinctive, identifiable attire may affect a juror’s judgment. The defendant’s clothing is so likely to be a continuing influence throughout the trial that, not unlike placing a jury in the custody of deputy sheriffs who were also witnesses for the prosecution, an unacceptable risk is presented of impermissible factors coming into play.”
