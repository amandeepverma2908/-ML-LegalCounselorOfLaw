Brief Fact Summary
Hutchinson (Defendant) was convicted of possession of marijuana for sale. On appeal, Defendant argued that the trial court committed prejudicial error in refusing to consider a juror affidavit detailing misconduct on the part of the court’s bailiff.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Jurors are competent witnesses to prove objective facts to impeach a verdict under Section 1150 of the Evidence Code.
