22 Ill.384 U.S. 333, 6 Ohio Misc. 231, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 16 L. Ed. 2d 600, 1 Med. L. Rptr. 1220 (1966)

Brief Fact Summary
An individual was accused of killing his pregnant wife.  The media coverage during the trial was overwhelming, to the point of being prejudicial to the defendant.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
“[W]here there is a reasonable likelihood that prejudicial news prior to trial will prevent a fair trial, the judge should continue the case until the threat abates, or transfer it to another county not so permeated with publicity.”

Issue
“[W]hether [the Petitioner] was deprived of a fair trial in his state conviction for the second-degree murder of his wife because of the trial judge’s failure to protect Sheppard sufficiently from the massive, pervasive and prejudicial publicity that attended his prosecution.”

Held
The majority recognized that “[l]egal trials are not like elections, to be won through the use of the meeting-hall, the radio, and the newspaper.”  Also, “the [Supreme] Court has insisted that no one be punished for a crime without ‘a charge fairly made and fairly tried in a public tribunal free of prejudice, passion, excitement, and tyrannical power.’  Moreover, “[f]reedom of discussion should be given the widest range compatible with the essential requirement of the fair and orderly administration of justice.”  However, “it must not be allowed to divert the trial from the ‘very purpose of a court system . . . to adjudicate controversies, both criminal and civil, in the calmness and solemnity of the courtroom according to legal procedures.’ ” One of the requirements is that “the jury’s verdict be based on evidence received in open court, not from outside sources.”
