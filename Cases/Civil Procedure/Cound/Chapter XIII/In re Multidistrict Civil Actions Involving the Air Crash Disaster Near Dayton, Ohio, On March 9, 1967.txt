Facts
On March 9, 1967, a mid-air collision occurred between aircrafts respectively owned by the Defendants near Dayton, Ohio. There were no survivors and numerous civil actions seeking recovery for alleged wrongful death and property damage were filed in various federal and state courts. Among those cases was a wrongful death action, Humphreys v. Herman Tann, et al, which commenced in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and was moved to the present court. This Court had, on July 15, 1970, conducted a pre-trial conference for the purpose of scheduling consolidated discovery with respect to all actions pending in front of it, including Humphreys. Plaintiffs’ attorney for that case was present and given a full and ample opportunity to participate in all discovery, framing of the issues, and ascertainment of all relevant facts pertaining to the crash. A second pre-trial conference was later held and an attorney named Spangenberg, a specialist in representations of plaintiffs’ cases in air disasters, gave a statements of facts with which all other present plaintiff’s attorneys concurred. At this hearing, it was decided that Downey v. TWA, Inc. would be the first case to commence to trial. Plaintiffs’ attorney in Humphreys was not present at this conference.

Held
Yes. The court concludes that no principle of fundamental fairness inherent in theconcept of due process will be offended by the application of the doctrine against plaintiffHumphreys to bar the relitigation of the issue of the Tann Company’s liability for themid-air disaster. In this Court’s opinion unfairness will result and the effectiveadministration of justice will be retarded if plaintiff Humphreys is permitted to relitigatean issue, which has been fully and fairly adjudicated.

Discussion
It is important to note that this decision did not conform to the weight ofstanding authority and was later overturned by the Sixth Circuit citing the overcrowdeddockets concern could not overcome the due process objections.The court came to its holding in the present case through the following reasoning. TheBernard Doctrine abandoned the requirement of strict mutuality and in the present case,two of the essential three elements for collateral estoppel were met: (i) A final judgmenton the merits had been met and (ii) the question of Tann Company’s negligence had beenfully litigated. The third element required privity of parties in the present case to those inthe Downey case and Humphreys was not a party to the case. Naturally, it would followthat privity not met as to the parties. Thus, the Tann Company could not invoke collateralestoppel. However, the court found that it did not believe that the maxim that each manbe afforded his day in court be so fixed so that it mandatorily apply where carefulevaluation of the record has been found. The Court reasoned that no principles offundamental fairness inherent in due process were offended by application of collateralestoppel as to Humphreys.
