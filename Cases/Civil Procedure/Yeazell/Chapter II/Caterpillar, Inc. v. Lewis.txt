Brief Fact Summary
Defendant James David Lewis, a resident of Kentucky, filed a lawsuit in Kentucky state court on June 22, 1989, after sustaining injuries while operating a bulldozer. He named as Defendants both a Delaware and Kentucky corporation.

Synopsis of Rule of Law

Facts
Defendant, a resident of Kentucky, filed a lawsuit in Kentucky state court on June 22, 1989, after sustaining injuries while operating a bulldozer. Defendant named as defendants both Plaintiff Caterpillar, Inc. the manufacturer, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Illinois, and the company that serviced the bulldozer, Whayne Supply Company, a Kentucky Corporation. Defendant later entered into a settlement agreement with Whayne, and shortly thereafter Plaintiff filed for removal to Federal District Court in Kentucky, asserting diversity jurisdiction. Defendant objected to the removal and moved to remand the case to state court.
