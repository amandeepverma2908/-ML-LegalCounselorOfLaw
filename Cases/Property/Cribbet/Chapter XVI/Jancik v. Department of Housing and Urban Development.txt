44 F.3d 553

Brief Fact Summary
Jancik, Petitioner, owns an apartment building, and ran an ad in a newspaper which was claimed by the Leadership Council for Metropolitan Open Communities to violate provisions of the Fair Housing Act (FHA).

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The FHA is violated where an ad for housing suggests to an ordinary reader that a particular group is preferred or dispreferred for the housing in question, which may be proven by subjective evidence of the intent of the person who places the ad.

Facts
Petitioner Jancik owns Building No. 44 in King Arthur’s Court, a large housing complex in Chicago. King Arthur’s Court is home to people of all ages, including children, and all the apartments have one bedroom, but are large enough under the housing code to house more than one person. On August 29, 1990, Jancik placed the following ad in the newspaper: “NORTHLAKE deluxe 1BR apt a/c, newer quiet bldg, pool, prkg, mature person preferred, credit checked. $395. . .” Due to the inclusion of the words “mature person” in the ad, the Leadership Council’s Investigations manager decided to “test” the property by having “testers” using fictitious names pose as potential renters in order to check for discriminatory practices. Cindy Gunderson, a white person, and Marsha Allen, a black person, were chosen to test the property. Gunderson spoke with Jancik by telephone on September 7, 1990, and during the conversation related her age of 36, to which Jancik said, “good- he doesn’t want any te

Issue
Does Jancik’s ad violate the FHA provisions such that the words “mature person preferred” indicate a non-preference of a particular protected group?

Held
Yes. Petition for review denied.

Discussion
In this case, the court applied an objective test focussed on the content of the ad and looked to the conduct of Jancik in his conversations to provide the basis for their decision.
