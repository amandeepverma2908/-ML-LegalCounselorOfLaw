Brief Fact Summary
Defendant Homeland, leased office space from Schlesinger, lessor. Homeland abandoned the property prior to the expiration on the lease and the premises were subsequently re-let to another tenant for a higher rent and longer term, who also defaulted.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When a commercial tenant abandons leased property there is no automatic termination of the lease when the lessor subsequently re-lets the property, and the original lessee may still be held liable for the periods of time under the original lease that the premises were vacant.

Facts
Lessor owns an office building in downtown Portland, Oregon. Homeland leased 3,000 square feet of office space from lessor for a five-year term, April 1, 1971 until March 31, 1976, which called for rent to be $1,175 per month for the first six months, $1,275 per month for the second six months and then for the last forty-eight months $1,415 per month. Homeland vacated the premises on July 31, 1973, with thirty-two months remaining on the lease, and paid no further rent. A receiver was appointed for Homeland. This case arose as a dispute between the lessor and the receiver for Homeland for unpaid rent following Homeland’s vacation of the property in July 1973. The property was re-let by lessor on February 1, 1974, to Sebastian’s for a longer term than the Homeland lease and for a higher rent. Sebastian’s subsequently vacated the premises on July 14, 1974, after paying total rent of $7,500. Lessor finally re-let the premises again effective August 1, 1975. Thus, lessor’s claim a

Issue
There are two issues:

Held
No to a. and No to b. Reversed and remanded, judgment for lessor of $26,460.

Discussion
The court, by imposing the duty to re-let by reasonable effort, opted not to offer landlords of vacant commercial property an inducement to keep the property vacant.
