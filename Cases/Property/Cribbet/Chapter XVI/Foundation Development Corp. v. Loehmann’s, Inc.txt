22 Ill.163 Ariz. 438, 788 P.2d 1189 (1990)

Brief Fact Summary
In this case tenant in a commercial lease failed to pay an amount due under the lease for a pro rata share of common area in a retail development, the lessor sought to terminate the lease due to the breach, which the Defendant lessee contended was a trivial breach.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In the commercial lease situation, this Court declines to hold that any breach, no matter how trivial, can justify a forfeiture.

Facts
Beginning in 1978 lessee (Loehmann’s) became the anchor tenant in a commercial development shopping center by entering into a twenty year lease with Plaintiff Foundation Development’s predecessor in interest. The lease contained no provision for percentage rent or rent increase, and was subject to two five year renewal options, which would make the total term of the lease a potential thirty years. In addition to the rent due to lessor each month, lessee was to pay common area charges for its proportionate share of total square footage in the shopping center. The customary practice of lessee was to pay estimated common area charges at the end of the first three quarters and to receive a final statement from lessor at the end of the last quarter itemizing the actual expenditures for the year, which lessee regularly paid more than thirty days after receipt of the adjusted statement. The lessee generally paid $50,000 per year ($45,000 in rent and $5,000 in annual common area charg

Issue
Does the trivial breach of lessee justify forfeiture of the premises and cancellation of the lease?

Held
No. Intermediate appellate court reversed, trial court’s decision reinstated.

Discussion
This opinion should be read carefully because it is well written and contains a discussion of the historical evolution of landlord-tenant law, particularly, the law in events of breach.
