22 Ill.68 U.S. 330, 1 Wall. 330, 17 L. Ed. 553 (1864)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff Dorothy Jones and Defendant James Green purchased property “as joint tenants with full rights of survivorship and not as tenants in common.” Thereafter, Plaintiff brought a suit to partition the property. Defendant moved for a summary judgment arguing that the property conveyed to unmarried individuals as joint tenants with full right of survivorship and not as tenants in common cannot be partitioned under Michigan law.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When property is conveyed as a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, one party may not deprive another of his right to survivorship and a partition may not be had.

Facts
Plaintiff Dorothy Jones and Defendant James Green purchased property “as joint tenants with full rights of survivorship and not as tenants in common.” Thereafter, Plaintiff brought a suit to partition the property. Defendant moved for a summary judgment arguing that the property conveyed to unmarried individuals as joint tenants with full right of survivorship and not as tenants in common cannot be partitioned under Michigan law. The trial court denied the Defendant’s motion for summary judgment and the Defendant appealed.

Issue
May the Plaintiff have the court order partition of the property held in joint tenancy with right of survivorship?

Held
No. Reversed. [The trial court should have granted Defendant's motion for summary judgment.]

Discussion
Do the words “with right of survivorship” merely explain an incident to joint tenancy or create a contract of a contingent remainder in the parties, subject to their survival? This case would be decided differently in other jurisdictions. In other cases the words “with right of survivorship” do not prevent one of the parties from alienating their portion of the interest.
