22 Ill.142 Mass. 383, 8 N.E. 128 (1884)

Brief Fact Summary
Two counters belonging to Defendant were put in a shop built by Warner and mortgaged to DeWitt. DeWitt foreclosed and sold the premises to Plaintiff, and Defendant came and retrieved the counters.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A purchaser is entitled to stand in as good a position as that of the seller in determining whether the remedy of replevin has passed by terms of the statute of limitations.

Facts
Two counters belonged to Defendant in 1867. Warner built a shop, installed the counters, and nailed them to the floor. Then, in 1871, Warner mortgaged the property to one DeWitt. In 1879 Dewitt’s executors foreclosed on the premises and sold the shop to Plaintiff. In 1881 Defendant took the counters from Plaintiff. Plaintiff then sued in replevin and the trial court ruled in favor of Defendant. Plaintiff filed a bill of exceptions.

Issue
Should Plaintiff be dispossessed of the counters when the statute of limitations for replevin had passed under the previous shop owner?

Held
No. Exceptions sustained. (New trial ordered).

Dissent
The dissent would strictly construct the language of the statute of limitations to mean that the statute is tolled each time the shop is sold.

Discussion
This holding in this case embodies a form of adverse possession or “limitation of title.” One should note that there are numerous exceptions to the rule articulated in this case.
