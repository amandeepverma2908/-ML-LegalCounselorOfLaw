22 Ill.121 N.H. 352, 430 A.2d 140 (1981)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff requested Defendant to approve her plans for a subdivision, which the Defendant’s planning board denied. The Plaintiff appealed the denial.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The regulations of local planning boards are given a broad scope and generally may include provisions, which will tend to create conditions favorable to health, safety, convenience or prosperity.

Facts
Plaintiff requested Defendant planning to approve her plans for a subdivision, which the Defendant’s planning board denied. The Plaintiff appealed the denial. The board refused to approve the Plaintiff’s plans for three reasons: 1) potential disruption of natural watercourses; 2) potential sight distance problems from the driveways exiting onto a State highway; and 3) potential problems with the subsurface septic systems due to an unusually high water table in the area.

Issue
Was the board within its rights to deny the Plaintiff’s plans for a new subdivision for the reasons stated?

Held
Yes. Affirmed.

Discussion
This case is an example of the great amount of power placed in the hands of local municipalities in determining the character of land use. Unless the action of the planning board could be shown to be unreasonable, the Plaintiff could not prevail.
