Brief Fact Summary
A husband and wife, the Niernbergs (Defendants), owned land which they agreed to sell to the Felds (Plaintiffs) under a “Receipt and Option” which provided for a $1,500 deposit. The Defendants then sold the property to another for greater than what the Plaintiffs had agreed to and thereafter refused to return the deposit.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An executory contract involving title to, or an interest in, land may be rescinded by an agreement resting in parol. The statute of frauds concerns the making of contracts and does not apply to rescission.

The Defendants then sold the

Discussion
This case could also be seen as a way for the court to avoid a result, which would allow the Defendants to be unjustly enriched by their dealings with the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs’ promise to release Defendants from the written agreement to sell in effect “freed” the Defendants to sell to another. Parol evidence is evidence of intent, which comes from outside the four corners of the instrument.
