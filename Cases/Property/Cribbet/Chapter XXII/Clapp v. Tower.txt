Brief Fact Summary
The executor of Tower’s will conveyed land to Plaintiff. Plaintiff sued to quiet title against Defendants, who are the deceased’s next of kin.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Equitable conversion is defined as a constructive alteration in the nature of property by which, in equity, real estate is regarded as personalty or personal estate as realty. 7 Amer. & Eng.Enc. of Law (2d Ed.) 464.

Facts
The land was sold under an executory contract to Hadley by Tower. Subsequent to this contract, Tower died. The executor foreclosed on the contract due to Hadley’s default. The executor, acting on the principle that equitable conversion applied to convert the land to personal property for purposes of administration, sold and conveyed the land to Plaintiff, who took both the deed and possession. The trial court found for Plaintiff and Defendants appealed.

Issue
Should the land have been treated as real estate or personal property under the will probate?

Held
The land should have been treated as personal property due to the rule of equitable conversion. Affirmed.

Discussion
An important part of the doctrine of equitable conversion is that the land is transformed by the legal fiction into personal property equal to the price due under the contract. The equitable title is in the vendee and the legal title is held by the vendor in trust for the vendee.
