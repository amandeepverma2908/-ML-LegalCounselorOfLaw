Plaintiffs took possession on May 1, 1943 and continued therein until April 30, 1944, paying a total of $570.00 during the term as rent and a total of $48.00 toward the purchase of the stove.

The Court stated two issues:

Held

Discussion
This case follows the restatement version of part performance. The oral agreement was within the statute of frauds, unless taken out by the doctrine of part performance. These cases are very fact-specific and the trial court’s findings are given deference by appellate courts.
