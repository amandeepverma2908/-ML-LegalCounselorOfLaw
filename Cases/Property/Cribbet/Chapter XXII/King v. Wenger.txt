22 Ill.219 Kan. 668, 549 P.2d 986 (1976)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff sued Defendant for specific performance based on a handwritten agreement.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The fact that the parties contemplate the execution of a formal document is evidence that they intend to not be bound until the execution of the formal contract.

Facts
The land in dispute is 160 acres, previously owned by sisters, Wenger and Ralston (Defendants), subject to a life estate in their mother, Ethel Wenger. Each sister owned an undivided half interest in the property. Ethel Wenger’s health began to deteriorate, and she discussed the advisability of selling the land with her two daughters. They agreed to sell the property, and the Defendants approached Plaintiff to have the land appraised. The Plaintiff declined to do so, but expressed an interest in purchasing the property. Ethel Wenger was hospitalized on December 26, 1972, and Plaintiff and Ethel Wenger’s daughter, Wenger visited to discuss purchasing the land. Ethel indicated that she might be willing to release her interest in the land so that it might be sold. The sales price of the land to Plaintiff was to be $16,000.00, and Plaintiff suggested that Wenger contact her other sister Ralston by telephone, which she did. Then, the Plaintiff and Wenger sat in Defendant’s car whil

Issue
Is the handwritten note a valid and enforceable contract for the sale of land?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
Note the insufficiencies in the handwritten note: the life tenant is not mentioned (though in the hospital), the lack of legal authority to bind Ralston, the lack of sufficient clarity as to the legal description. Therefore, the court would not conclude that the parties intended to be bound. This is not a case for part performance, because the Plaintiff did nothing until the property had been sold to someone else.
