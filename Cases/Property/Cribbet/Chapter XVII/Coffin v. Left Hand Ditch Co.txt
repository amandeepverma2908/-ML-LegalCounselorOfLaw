22 Ill.6 Colo. 443 (1882)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff owned land, which was irrigated by Left Hand creek through a series of ditches, which placed water in the Left Hand creek by diverting water from the St. Vrain creek to the James creek. The Defendants owned land which was near the St. Vrain creek below the diversion point and which was irrigated from the St. Vrain. During a drought in 1879 the water stopped flowing to the Defendants’ lands and they went onto the lands of the Plaintiff to tear up the dams.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The right to water is established by the priority of appropriation of the water, and not by riparian proprietorship.

Facts
Plaintiff owned land, which was irrigated by the Left Hand creek through a series of ditches, which placed water in the Left Hand creek by diverting water from the St. Vrain creek to the James creek. The Defendants owned land which was near the St. Vrain creek below the diversion point and which was irrigated from the St. Vrain. During a drought in 1879, the water stopped flowing to the Defendants’ lands and they went onto the lands of the Plaintiff to tear up the dams. The Plaintiff sued Defendants for trespass and for an injunction to prevent further trespasses in the future. The Defendants contend that the common law principle of riparian proprietorship applied in Colorado and not the concept of priority of priority of appropriation.

Issue
What is the proper legal rule to decide this case?

Held
The right to water by priority of appropriation. Affirmed.

Discussion
The doctrine of prior appropriation, is recognized in western states and in Mississippi, which generally allows an earlier user of water the right to the water before allowing later users a right to the water. Whereas, the doctrine of riparian rights, is generally recognized elsewhere and allows equal rights between riparian users.
