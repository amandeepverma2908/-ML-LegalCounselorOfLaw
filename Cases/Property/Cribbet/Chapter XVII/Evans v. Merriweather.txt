4 Ill. 491

Brief Fact Summary
Merriweather (Plaintiff) owned a mill downstream from Evans’s (Defendant) mill. The stream, which powered both mills, was usually of sufficient flow to not cause any problems, but in 1837, a drought caused the stream to lose a considerable amount of flow. The Defendant diverted the stream, by using a dam, into Defendant’s well, causing Plaintiff’s mill to cease operation.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A person with a stream running through their land may use all of the stream if the use is for home or livestock, but when the use is for manufacturing, the stream must have enough left for downstream proprietors.

Facts
The Plaintiff owns a mill that is downstream from Defendant’s mill. The stream, which powered both mills, was usually of sufficient flow to not cause any problems, but in 1837, a drought caused the stream to lose a considerable amount of flow. The Defendant diverted the stream, by using a dam, into Defendant’s well. The Plaintiff’s mill was not operational due to the stream being dry. Plaintiff brought suit three or four weeks after Defendant had dammed the stream, and Plaintiff obtained a verdict of $150.00. The parties had stipulated to a statement of facts which include that Defendant hauled in extra water for his boilers and that the water was placed into Defendant’s well along with the stream water.

Issue
To what extent can riparian proprietors use the water of a non-navigable stream?

Held
Defendant Evans illegally diverted the whole of the stream into his well.

Discussion
This case is important for its discussion of the principles involved in stream use cases. The reasonable use doctrine is an important method of deciding these cases. Notice that the use would have been reasonable if it was “natural,” i.e. to quench thirst, but unreasonable if “artificial,” i.e. manufacturing.
