22 Ill.108 Ariz. 178, 494 P.2d 700, 4 ERC 1052 (1972)

Brief Fact Summary
In 1956, Spur Industries, Inc.’s (Defendant’s) predecessor established cattle feed lots in a rural area outside of Phoenix. In 1959, Webb Development Co. (Plaintiff) established a residential development called Sun City. Both the feed lot and the development has since expanded. Plaintiff has sued Defendant for an injunction arising from the nuisance created by the feed lot due to flies and odor, which drifts into Sun City with the wind.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
“Coming to the nuisance” acts to bar relief when a plaintiff has knowingly entered into an area reserved for industry or agriculture.

Facts
The lower court ruled in favor of the Plaintiff and permanently enjoined the Defendant’s feed lot operation. The Defendant appealed.

Issue
Can the Plaintiff enjoin the operation of Defendant’s feed lot?

Held
Yes. However, the Plaintiff must indemnify Defendant for the cost of moving the operation. Affirmed in part, reversed in part.

Discussion
This court was clearly concerned with protecting the citizens of Sun City from a public nuisance, but it also balanced that concern with the rights of the Defendant. When a plaintiff has knowingly entered into an area reserved for industry or agriculture, he or she is “coming to the nuisance,” i.e., this will act as a bar to an action for nuisance.
