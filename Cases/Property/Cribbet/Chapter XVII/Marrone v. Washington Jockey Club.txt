22 Ill.227 U.S. 633, 33 S. Ct. 401, 57 L. Ed. 679 (1913)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff, who was prevented from entering a track after buying a ticket, sued the Defendant track for trespass.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A ticket for admission upon the property of another does not create a property right in the ticket holder, and the only right of the holder is in contract.

Facts
Plaintiff was prevented from entering on the grounds of Bennings Race Track two days in a row after buying a ticket. The Plaintiff sued in trespass and also charged that the track had refused his entry because he accused the Defendants of a conspiracy to drug a horse he entered in a race. The court found that no evidence of such a conspiracy was introduced. The court found that the argument by Plaintiff was an attempt to overturn the common law rule that the purchase of a ticket does not create a property right.

Issue
Can a ticket-holder sue for trespass for being denied entry by the ticket issuer?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
Plaintiff, as the court pointed out, should have sought a remedy through a breach of contract action and not in trespass.
