22 Ill.1 S.W.3d 75 (Tex. 1999)

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiffs sued the Great Spring Waters of America, Inc. (Defendant), a water bottling company, for depleting the ground waters and drying up the Plaintiffsâ€™ wells.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Under the capture rule, a landowner may pump as much groundwater as he chooses without liability to neighbors for drying up their wells.

Facts
The lower court granted summary judgment in favor of the Defendant on the basis of a 90-year-old rule of law, the capture rule. Under the capture rule, a landowner may pump as much groundwater as he chooses without liability to neighbors for drying up their wells. The Plaintiffs appealed to try and get the higher court to adopt a rule of reasonable use.

Issue
Should the court adopt the reasonable use rule and overturn the long-standing capture rule?

Held
No. Affirmed. The court saw no reason to make sweeping changes to the Texas groundwater rules.

Discussion
Under the capture rule, a landowner may pump as much groundwater as he chooses without liability to neighbors for drying up their wells. Although the court noted that most states no longer follow the capture rule, the court was reluctant to change the law in Texas.
