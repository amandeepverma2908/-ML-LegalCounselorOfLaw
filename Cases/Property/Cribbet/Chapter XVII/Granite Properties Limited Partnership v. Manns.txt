22 Ill.117 Ill. 2d 425 (1987)

Brief Fact Summary
Granite Properties Limited Partnership (Plaintiff) brought suit against Larry and Ann Manns (Defendants) to permanently enjoin Defendants from interfering with the use of two driveways to which Plaintiff claims easements.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An easement may be implied by prior use even if the conveyor of a parcel, which was once contiguous, is the claimant of the easement.

Facts
An apartment complex and a shopping center are situated on Plaintiff’s property. One driveway connects the rear of the shopping center to a public road and runs partly across Defendant’s land. The other driveway connects the apartment complex’s parking lot to another public road and also runs partly across Defendant’s land. [note: page 518 of the text contains an extremely useful diagram of the properties in question as they relate to one another]. The Plaintiff and its predecessors in title owned the entire parcel from 1963 until 1982 when a parcel situated behind the grocery store and between the grocery store and the apartment complex was sold to Defendants by warranty deed.

Issue

Held
Yes. Judgment of intermediate appellate court affirmed.

Discussion
This case should be closely read insofar as it contains an excellent discussion of an implied easement.
