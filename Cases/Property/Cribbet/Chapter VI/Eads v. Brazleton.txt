22 Ill.22 Ark. 499 (1861)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff discovered a sunken steamboat with a cargo of lead which Plaintiff planned to salvage, but the Defendants came and salvaged the lead while Plaintiff was elsewhere making repairs to his boat.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In order for a court to sustain a claim of title by occupancy, the finder must establish that there was actual possession of the object so claimed.

Facts
The steamboat America sank in the Mississippi River in 1827 with a cargo of lead. In January of 1855, Plaintiff arrived to find the location of the America on the riverbed and did find the location of the wreck which he marked with a temporary buoy and markings of trees which would guide him back to the location. Thereafter, Plaintiff was delayed from recovering the wreck by the necessity to make repairs to his boat. On September 28, 1855, the Defendants, a salvage firm of Eads and Nelson independently found the America and began raising the cargo. Plaintiff, being aggrieved, filed suit in the chancery division of the Circuit Court of Mississippi County claiming that he had established a title by right of occupancy in the America and that the Defendants were interfering with such title. The lower court ruled in favor of the Plaintiff.

Issue
Did the lower court properly rule that Plaintiff had established his title in the America by virtue of title by occupancy?

Held
No. The judgment is reversed.

Discussion
In cases such as this where property is abandoned in a public location any person may claim ownership of the property provided they find and show some evidence of title by occupancy.
