22 Ill.155 Tex. 195, 284 S.W.2d 333 (1955)

Brief Fact Summary
The Petitioner (Defendant at trial) owned a house with a garage which needed to have concrete added on the floor over dirt and Petitioner hired Respondent’s employer to perform the concrete laying, during the course of which Respondent found $1000 which had been buried.
