22 Ill.1927 OK 260, 126 Okla. 246, 259 P. 219

Brief Fact Summary
Clevenger (Plaintiff) owned a building in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, which she considered trading to Simmons for an apartment building. Peay, acting as an intermediate, took a deed to Simmons, which Peay was to hold pending Plaintiff’s investigation of Simmons’ Tulsa property.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
No title will pass by a deed, which is not delivered by the grantor or someone duly authorized by him.

Facts
Plaintiff owned a building in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, which she considered trading to Simmons for an apartment building that Simmons owned in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Peay, acting as an intermediate, took a deed to Simmons, which was executed by Plaintiff. Peay was to hold this deed pending Plaintiff’s investigation of Simmons’ Tulsa property. If Plaintiff did not approve the trade, the deed was to be returned to Plaintiff. Plaintiff left Bartlesville for a time and upon returning found that the deed to Simmons had been recorded and that Simmons had since deeded the property to Moore (Defendant). Plaintiff sued for possession of the property, and for cancellation of the deed. The trial court found for Defendant, and Plaintiff appealed.

Issue
Two issues were stated by the court:

Held
The deed is void, and the rights of an innocent purchaser for value are discussed below. Reversed and remanded.

Discussion
The fraudulent procurement of the deed can be inferred from the facts of the case. The Plaintiff clearly delivered the deed to Peay to hold in escrow, conditioned on her investigation of Simmons’ Tulsa property. In considering Peay’s liability to Plaintiff, it would seem that a confidential or fiduciary relationship has been breached.
