Brief Fact Summary
A conveyance from son (Plaintiff) to father (Defendant) of a life estate in favor of the Defendant was challenged as being statutorily insufficient as being attested by only one witness when the statute required two witnesses.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Under the statute of uses, 27 Hen. VIII. Cap.10, “where any person stands seised of any lands to the use of any other person by reason of bargain, sale or feoffment, such person that have any such use shall be deemed and adjudged in lawful seisen, estate and possession thereof, to all intents and purposes.”

Facts
A purported conveyance from Plaintiff to Defendant of a life estate in favor of the Defendant was challenged as being statutorily insufficient because only one witness attested to the conveyance. The statute required two witnesses.

Issue
There are two issued presented:

Held
No. Judgment for the Defendant.

Discussion
Clearly the facts suggested the following scenario: First, the Defendant grants the Plaintiff the deed to the lands, including the portion, which the Defendant lived on. Secondly, the Plaintiff gave a statutorily ineffective conveyance of a life estate back to the Defendant. Thirdly, the Plaintiff challenged the validity of the life estate in favor of Defendant. The court found that the consideration for the first transfer was based on blood. The statute of uses is an equitable solution to the statutory problems of the second transfer.
