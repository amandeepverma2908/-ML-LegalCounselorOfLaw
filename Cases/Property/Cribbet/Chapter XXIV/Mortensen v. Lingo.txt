22 Ill.99 F. Supp. 585, 13 Alaska 419 (D. Alaska 1951)

Brief Fact Summary
On February 20, 1941, McCain conveyed real property to Anglin. The deed was recorded in the office of the recorder for the Anchorage recording district, but was not indexed as the statute directed. Then, in 1947, McCain conveyed the same property to Defendant, who then conveyed the land to the Plaintiffs who allege that Anglin threatens to evict Plaintiffs.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
All the prescribed steps, including indexing, had to be performed before the record could constitute constructive notice.

Facts
On February 20, 1941, McCain conveyed the real property to Anglin. The deed was recorded in the office of the recorder for the Anchorage recording district, but was not indexed as the statute directed. Then, in 1947, McCain conveyed the same property to Defendant, who then conveyed the land to the Plaintiffs who allege that Anglin threatens to evict Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs then filed suit against Defendant for breach of covenants of title. The facts do not evidence that Defendant ever had actual notice of the prior conveyance to Anglin.

Issue
Did the Defendant have constructive notice of the prior conveyance to Anglin by McCain such that the Plaintiffs, subsequent innocent purchasers for value, may recover from Defendant for breach of covenants of title?

Held
No. The recording of the deed to Anglin without indexing was insufficient to give constructive notice to the Defendant.

Discussion
The court made it fairly clear that the result achieved by its ruling would prevent damage to innocent purchasers for value, such as the Defendant. The Defendant had no way, other than to look through the entire long form deed books, to discover that McCain had previously conveyed the property to Anglin.
