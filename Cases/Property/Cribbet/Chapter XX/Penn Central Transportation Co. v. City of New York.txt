Brief Fact Summary

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In deciding whether a particular government action has effected a taking, this Court focuses both on the character of the action and the nature and extent of the interference with rights in the parcel as a whole.

Facts
Appellant owned the Grand Central Terminal, which was designated by application of New York’s Landmarks Preservation Law to be a landmark. Thereafter, the Appellant entered into a renewable 50-year lease with UGP Properties, Ltd., a United Kingdom company, under which the UGP agreed to construct a multistory office building on top of the terminal. The plans for the new office building were submitted to the Commission for approval, which was denied.

Has a taking occurred?

Discussion
This case should be read closely as it contains an excellent discussion of the permissible scope of zoning regulations and the requirements for finding that a taking has occurred. The Court did stretch a bit to uphold the Landmarks Law based on its analogy to zoning.
