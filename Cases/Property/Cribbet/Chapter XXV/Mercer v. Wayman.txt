Facts
This case involved a dispute between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants to set aside oil and gas leases by the Defendants and to have the Plaintiffs declared the sole owners of the 40-acre tract in question.

Would the father have quitclaimed his own interest, but intended that his minor sons retain an interest?
