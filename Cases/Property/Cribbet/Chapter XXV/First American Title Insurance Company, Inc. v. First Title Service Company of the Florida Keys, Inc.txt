Brief Fact Summary
In this case the Plaintiff, First American Title Insurance Company (Plaintiff), brought an action against the Defendant, First Title Service Company of the Florida Keys (Defendant) alleging that the Defendant had prepared abstracts for the sellers of two lots and that the Plaintiff relied on the abstracts to issue title insurance for owners and mortgagees for the lenders and the buyers of the two lots.

Issue
Did the action state a complaint upon which relief could be granted?

Held
Yes. The decision of the intermediate appellate court is quashed and the case is remanded.

Discussion
In practice, it is ordinarily apparent to an abstracter what is the immediate intended purpose of the abstract. Obviously, the abstracter’s client purchases the abstract for their use. The liability of the abstracter become more murky the further away from privity the use of the faulty abstract gets. Does the Court announce a rule that is apparent and easily understandable as to how far away from privity the liability would reach?
