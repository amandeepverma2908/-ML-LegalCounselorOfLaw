75 Ill. 2d 547

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiffs brought suit for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment after discovering they were not in possession of all of the mineral rights to the property they purchased.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Until one holding a paramount title interferes with Plaintiff’s right of possession, there can be no constructive eviction and no breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

Facts
In 1947, the owner of 80 acres conveyed it to the Bosts, but reserved 2/3 interest in the mineral rights on the land. In 1957, the Bosts conveyed the land by general warranty deed to the Browns, the Plaintiffs (Plaintiffs). In 1974, the Plaintiffs attempted to sell the mineral rights to the land and learned they were only in possession of 1/3 of the mineral rights. Plaintiffs sued the Defendant, the executor of the owner’s estate, Lober (Defendant), for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. The trial court ruled in favor of the Defendant. The appellate court reversed, and the Plaintiffs appealed.

Issue
Whether the plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to constitute a constructive eviction?

Held
Reversed. To have a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiffs would have to demonstrate that someone holding a paramount title interfered with Plaintiffs’ right to possession.

Discussion
The court focused on the premise that even if an individual is aware that there is a person holding paramount title to his own, that person must actively interfere with their right to possession before the covenant of quiet enjoyment can be breached. The Plaintiffs in this case have been in no way hindered as of yet in their enjoyment of their land. They merely were put on notice that there existed another individual with rights in their property.
