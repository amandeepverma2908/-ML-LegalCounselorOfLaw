Brief Fact Summary
Lessee brought suit to recover damages from lessor. After signing a lease, the lessee discovered former tenants, which the lessor refused to evict, occupied the property.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Under the American rule, the lessee has a right to possession, but absent an explicit covenant, the lessor has no duty to deliver possession.

Facts
The Plaintiff, Hannan (Plaintiff), leased property from the Defendant, Dusch (Defendant), for a term of 15 years. When the Plaintiff attempted to take possession of the property, he discovered there were tenants still on the property. Defendant refused to take action to evict tenants and argued that it was the Plaintiff’s duty to see that the premises were available. The Plaintiff sued to recover damages.

Issue
Whether a landlord, without any express covenant to deliver possession of the property is required by law to deliver possession of the property.

Held
Affirmed, the landlord has no duty to deliver possession of the property unless both parties specifically covenanted for it.

Discussion
The court discussed the two conflicting rules applicable to the case. The English rule on one hand, implies a covenant requiring the lessor to put the lessee in possession. The American rule, on the other hand, recognizes the lessee’s right to possession, but imposes no duty on the lessor to deliver possession. The court noted that there were remedies available to the lessee under Virginia law regarding unlawful entry and detainer. Therefore the American rule was the rule that Virginia chose to adopt.
