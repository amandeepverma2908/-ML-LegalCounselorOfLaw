Brief Fact Summary
Landlord sues for rent for the entire period of the lease when tenant vacated apartment prior to expiration of the lease.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A landlord has a duty to mitigate damages by attempting to re-let an apartment vacated by a tenant at fair market value.

Facts
The Defendant, Kridel (Defendant) signed a two-year lease for an apartment owned by the Plaintiff, Sommer (Plaintiff). The Defendant paid the security deposit and first monthâ€™s rent. Prior to even obtaining the keys to the apartment, the Defendant broke off his engagement, became a student and attempted to terminate the lease by letter to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff did not attempt to re-let the apartment until months later. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for the full amount due under the two-year lease. The trial court found that the Plaintiff had a duty to mitigate by attempting to re-let the premises. The appellate court reversed and the Defendant appealed.

Issue
Whether a landlord seeking damages from a defaulting tenant has a duty to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to re-let an apartment wrongfully vacated by a tenant.

Held
Reversed, a landlord does have an obligation to make a reasonable effort to mitigate damages in this situation for the following reasons:

Discussion
The court overruled precedent based on the theory that when the landlord signed the lease with a tenant, the landlord may not interfere with the estate granted to the tenant by the lease. The court noted that a lease for residential property could no longer be distinguished from an ordinary contract and thus was subject to the contract rule requiring mitigation of damages.
