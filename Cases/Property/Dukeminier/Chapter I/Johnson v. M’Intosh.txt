21 U.S. 543, 5 L. Ed. 681, 1823 .S. 8 Wheat. 543

Brief Fact Summary
Action for ejectment for lands in the State of Illinois, in which plaintiff claims superior title under purchase and conveyance from the certain Indian nations over defendant under a later grant from the United States.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Discovery of land gives the exclusive right to settle, possess, and govern the new land, and the absolute title to the soil, subject to certain rights of occupancy only in the natives.

Facts
Johnson (P) claimed title to property conveyed under two grants, one in 1773 and the other in 1775, by the chiefs of the Illinois and Piankeshaw nations. P contends superior title because his title came directly from the Indian nations who owned the land. D claims superior title due to a direct conveyance from the United States government. District Court held for D. P appeals.

Issue
Whether a title conveyed by the Native Americans can be recognized by the Federal Courts?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
The United States holds absolute title with the exclusive right to convey land while the Native Indians only had a right of occupancy that can be extinguished at any time. Conquest gives title that the Courts cannot deny; therefore property rights are defined by law.
