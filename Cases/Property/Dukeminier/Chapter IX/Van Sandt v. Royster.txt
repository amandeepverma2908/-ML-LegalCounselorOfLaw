148 Kan. 495, 83 P.2d 698, 1938 Kan.

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff, Van Sandt (Plaintiff), discovered that his basement was flooded with sewage and brought an action to enjoin the Defendant, Royster (Defendant), from using and maintaining the underground sewer. The pipe crossed a single property encompassing both lots and the adjacent lot in 1904 that was owned by Bailey.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An easement is implied to protect the probable expectations of the grantor and grantee that a prior existing use will continue after the transfer. Thus, where the grantee is aware of a reasonably necessary use of the grantee’s property for the comfortable enjoyment of the grantor’s property an easement by implication is created.

Facts
The Plaintiff owns lot 19 and the Defendant owns lot 20. Both lots were part of the adjacent estate, lot 4, which was owned by Bailey in 1903-1904 and is now owned by Gray. Bailey constructed the pipe in late 1903 or early 1904 for the common benefit of all three lots. At that time, it was all one property so there is no dominant / servient estate. Lot 19 was conveyed in January 1904 and Lot 20 was also conveyed in 1904. The original conveyee of Van Sandt’s land was aware of the lateral sewer.

Issue
Is there an apparent easement even though the sewer drain pipe is not readily visible?

Held
An apparent easement existed. An easement need not be visible to be apparent. Appliances connected with and leading to the property were obvious adaptations of the property that led to a sewer. The Plaintiff purchased the property upon careful inspection and knowledge that the property had modern plumbing. Plaintiff was thus charged with notice of the sewer.

Discussion
The court follows the Restatement of Property factors rather than the common law rule of strict necessity.
