Brief Fact Summary
Neighbors brought suit to enjoin further use of residential property as an AIDS Group Home and to enforce a restrictive covenant against the group home.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A group home is used for residential purposes by unrelated persons who can constitute a single family within the meaning of the local zoning definition of family.

Facts
The Defendant, Community of Damien of Molokai (Defendant), leased the residence located in Albequerque, New Mexico. The group home had four AIDS and other terminally ill patients residing there. The Plaintiffs, Hill and other neighbors (Plaintiffs), live on the same dead end street as group home is located and noticed an increase in traffic going to and from the group home. The restrictive covenant on all the homes in the installment encompassing the group home and the neighbors’ homes said the lots were not to be used for any purpose other than single family residences.

Issue
Does the restriction to use as a “single family residence” prohibit the establishment of Defendant’s group home?

Held
The purpose of a group home is to provide residents with a traditional family structure and atmosphere and as matter of law that is a use for residential purposes. In addition, residents of a group home meet the requirement of a “single family” because local ordinances define family to include any group of not more than five unrelated persons.

Discussion
The FHA applied because the group home residents were handicapped by definition because of their HIV Positive status. Since the covenant itself failed to define “family,” the local ordinances were used, which included unrelated persons. There are strong policy considerations in favor of group homes.
