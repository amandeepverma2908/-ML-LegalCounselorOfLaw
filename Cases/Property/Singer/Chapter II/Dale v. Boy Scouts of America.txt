Brief Fact Summary
The Boy Scouts revoked the membership of an openly gay Scout leader, claiming it was expressive association.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Under the First Amendment’s freedom of expressive association, a group does not need to accept members whose presence impedes their ability to advocate their viewpoint.

Facts
The Boy Scouts of America (Defendant) is a private, nonprofit organization whose mission is to teach boys about values. Assistant scoutmaster Dale (Plaintiff) is openly gay and is also a gay rights activist. Defendant revoked Plaintiff’s membership, claiming its policy specifically forbids membership to homosexuals, though the Scout Oath and Law do not specifically mention sexuality or sexual orientation.

Issue
May a group exclude homosexuals?

Held
Yes.

Dissent
The terms ‘morally straight’ and ‘clean’ have nothing to do with homosexuality, so the Boy Scouts have not proclaimed any anti-gay philosophy. Also, the Boy Scout Handbook does not mention homosexuality. Joining the Boy Scouts is not symbolic speech. Homosexuals are being singled out for special First Amendment treatment.

Discussion
An expressive association does not need to accept members whose views differ strongly from their own.
