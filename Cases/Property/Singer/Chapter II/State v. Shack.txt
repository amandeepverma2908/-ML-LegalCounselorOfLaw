Brief Fact Summary
Two men entered private land in order to aid migrant farmworkers. The owner asked them to leave, but they refused. The men were charged with trespass.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Trespass does not include a situation where representatives of recognized charitable groups enter private land in order to provide government aid to those workers who need it.

Facts
One defendant is a field worker for a nonprofit corporation that provided for the health services of migrant farm workers. Another defendant is an attorney for a nonprofit corporation that provides legal advice and representation for these workers. The two defendants went to the farm of the plaintiff, who confronted them at the entrance. The plaintiff offered to bring both men to his office, but the defendants wanted to see the men in their living quarters outside the supervision of the plaintiff. The plaintiff summoned a state trooper, and the defendants were charged with trespass.

Issue
Does trespass on real property include the right to bar access to governmental services available to migrant workers?

Held
No. Judgment reversed.

Discussion
Nonowners may enter onto an ownerâ€™s property in order to provide governmental services, even if the owner objects to the entry.
