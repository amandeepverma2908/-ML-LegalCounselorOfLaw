440 N.W.2d 867,1989 Iowa Sup.

Brief Fact Summary
Tenants created an association to assert their rights, and the landlord then served some members with eviction papers.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Landlords may not engage in retaliatory eviction. However, a tenant who proves a retaliatory purpose is not entitled to remain in possession in perpetuity. If the illegal purpose ends, the landlord can, in the absence of legislation or a binding contract, evict the tenant for legitimate reasons or for no reason at all.

Facts
A mobile home park is owned by Hillview Associates (Plaintiffs). Tenants met to discuss the physical condition of the land and the increases in rent and then formed a tenant’s association. The association had several disagreements with management over the land. A tenant struck a manager during a meeting. Several members of the association were given notice of termination, but the notice did not provide specific grounds for termination. The tenants did not leave, and so Plaintiffs filed a forcible entry and detainer action. The tenants raised the defense of retaliatory eviction and waiver.

Issue
Can a landlord evict tenants as retaliation for their membership in a tenant’s association?

Held
No.

Discussion
A landlord cannot retaliate against tenants for asserting their right to habitable premises.
