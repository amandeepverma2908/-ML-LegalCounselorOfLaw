Brief Fact Summary
A person claims adverse possession on land described in an invalid deed.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A deed has a proper description of land if it is possible by reasonable rules of construction to ascertain from the description what property is intended to be conveyed.

Facts
In 1947, Ida Romero (Plaintiff) and her husband purchased land from the husband’s father. The husband’s mother did not sign the deed, though her husband did. (Both are Defendants). Plaintiff and her husband built a home on a portion of the land. They lived in the home until 1962, when the husband died. Plaintiff attempts to quiet title to the land.

Issue
When determining if a deed gives an adequate description of land for purposes of adverse possession, may extrinsic evidence be used to ascertain the boundaries?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
When one holds property under color of title (i.e., a void deed), he will obtain title to the whole area described in the deed under adverse possession, as long as extrinsic evidence can aid in giving an exact location of the land.
