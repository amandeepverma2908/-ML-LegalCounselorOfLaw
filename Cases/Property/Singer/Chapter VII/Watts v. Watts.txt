Brief Fact Summary
A couple, together for twelve years, terminated their relationship. The woman seeks to recover property she helped acquire during their relationship.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Even if parties are not married and did not have a formal agreement as to property rights, property distribution can be obtained through contract and unjust enrichment claims.

Facts
Sue Ann Evan Watts (Plaintiff) and James Watts (Defendant) began living together in a marriage-like relationship. They held themselves out as husband and wife. Plaintiff assumed Defendant’s surname, and so did the two children they had together. Plaintiff was on Defendant’s insurance policy. Plaintiff provided childcare and homemaking services. Eventually, she worked part time at his office. After twelve years together, she moved from their home and ended their relationship. Defendant barred her from returning to work. Plaintiff asserts that her contributions increased the business and personal wealth of the couple. She asserts that they had a contract to share equally the property accumulated during their relationship and the Defendant breached it when he refused to share equally with her the wealth accumulated through their joint efforts.

Issue
When the relationship of an unmarried couple terminates and one party attempts to retain an unreasonable amount of property acquired through the efforts of both, can a claim of breach of contract and unjust enrichment be successfully brought?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
Allowing no relief to one party in an unmarried relationship effectively provided total relief to the other, by leaving that party with all the assets that were acquired by the efforts of both. That would be an unfair result, as this court notes.
