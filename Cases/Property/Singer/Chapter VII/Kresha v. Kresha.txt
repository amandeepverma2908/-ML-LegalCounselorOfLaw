220 Neb. 598,371 N.W.2d 280, 1985 Neb.

Brief Fact Summary
A married couple was a tenant in common of a piece of land. Without the knowledge and consent of one party, the other party leased land to a third party.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
One of several tenants in common can lease his interest to a third party, and if the ownership of the land is conveyed to one tenant, that tenant takes the land subject to the third party’s interest.

Facts
Adolph Kresha and Rose Kresha (Plaintiff) owned land as tenants in common. Joseph Kresha (Defendant) is their son. The father, without the consent, knowledge or authority of the mother, leased a part of the land to Defendant. The parents were divorced, and the land was awarded to Plaintiff. Plaintiff attempted to terminate Defendant’s lease and brought a forcible entry and detainer action to obtain possession of the land.

Issue
When spouses own property as tenants in common, but the marriage dissolves and one party gets ownership of the land, does the owner take the land subject to the encumbrances placed on it by the former spouse?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
A lease by a spouse who is a tenant in common with his or her partner will survive when the parties divorce.
