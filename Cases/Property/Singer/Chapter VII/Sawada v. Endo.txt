57 Haw. 608,561 P.2d 1291, 1977 Haw.

Brief Fact Summary
The driver of a motor vehicle involved in a car accident conveyed land to his sons with no consideration after a suit was filed against him.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In a tenancy by the entirety, the interest of a spouse is not subject to the claims of creditors during the joint lives of the spouses.

Facts
Masako Sawada and Helen Sawada (Plaintiffs) were injured when struck by a car driven by Kokichi Endo (Defendant). Defendant owned, along with his wife, a parcel of land as of the date of the accident (November 30, 1968). On July 26, 1969, he deeded the property to his sons, but received no consideration in return. Defendant and his wife continued to live on the property. Plaintiffs received a judgment in their favor on January 19, 1971. Defendantâ€™s wife died on January 29, 1971. Plaintiffs brought suit to set aside the conveyance in an attempt to obtain satisfaction of the judgment. The trial court refused and Plaintiffs appeal.

Issue
When spouses hold property in tenancy by the entireties, will the interest of one spouse be subject to the claims of his or her creditors while both spouses are alive?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Dissent
The separate interest of a husband in a tenancy by entirety, at least to the extent of his right of survivorship, is alienable by him and subject to attachment by his separate creditors. When the husband fraudulently conveys his property, the conveyance should be set aside.

Discussion
Creditors cannot reach property when it is held as a tenancy by the entirety to satisfy debts when the other spouse has not consented.
