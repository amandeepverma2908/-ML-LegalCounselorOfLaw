Brief Fact Summary
A spouse sought to have a professional license declared as marital property, thus subject to equitable distribution.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An interest in a professional or professional career potential is marital property, which may be represented by direct or indirect contributions of the non-title holding spouse.

Facts
Plaintiff and Defendant married. They moved to Mexico so Plaintiff could go to medical school full-time. Defendant taught school and contributed her earnings to their joint expenses. They moved back to America so Plaintiff could finish school. Two months after Plaintiff received is license, he filed this action for divorce.

Issue
Is a professional license of one party subject to equitable distribution in a divorce?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
The court reads a broad definition of property to include professional licenses acquired during the marriage. They believe that a professional license is obtained through a joint effort of spouses, not the work of one.
