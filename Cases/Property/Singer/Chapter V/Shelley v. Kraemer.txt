Brief Fact Summary
A group of property owners signed an agreement that would prevent minorities from buying property in the neighborhood.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
If a covenant is racially discriminatory, judicial enforcement would constitute state action and thus be in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Facts
A group of property owners entered into an agreement which restricted the sale of land to whites only. Forty-seven parcels of land, out of fifty in the area, were involved in the agreement. Shelley (Petitioner) bought one of the parcels but did not know of the restrictive agreement at the time of the purchase. The owners of other property subject to the restrictive covenant (Respondents) brought suit to prevent Petitioner from taking the property.

Issue
If the judiciary attempts to enforce a covenant made by private individuals that discriminates based on race, will that action violate the Fourteenth Amendment?

Held
Yes. Judgment reversed.

Discussion
When a covenant is racially discriminatory, the courts will not enforce it because doing so would violate the Constitution. All individuals have the right to participate in the housing market.
