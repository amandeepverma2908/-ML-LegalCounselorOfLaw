806 P.2d 1054 (N.M. 1991).

Brief Fact Summary
Homeowners in a subdivision sue the developer, alleging he broke restrictive covenants.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Provisions allowing for the amendment of restrictive covenants will be allowed, as long as the amendments are reasonable so as not to destroy the general plan or scheme of the development.

Facts
Presley Companies (Defendants) recorded restrictive covenants concerning a subdivision. The covenants regulated the land use, building type, quality and size of the residential single-family dwellings. The Appels (Plaintiffs) bought a home in a subdivision after representations were made about the subdivision and the purpose of the restrictive covenants, and they relied on these representations when they purchased the lot. After their purchase, the subdivision committee made amendments to the covenants, and townhouses were constructed on the lots. The restrictive covenants contained a provision that allowed for amendment of the covenants.

Issue
Can a subdivision committee make changes to restrictive covenants without the consent of landowners, if those changes are reasonable?

Held
Yes. Judgment reversed and remanded.

Discussion
Even after real property is purchased, restrictive covenants may be changed by the seller, provided that those changes are reasonable and fit into the development scheme.
