448 So. 2d 1166, 1984 Fla. App.

Brief Fact Summary
A condominium owner sold her unit without obtaining the consent of the board of directors, which violated a provision of the condominium rules.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A condominium associate cannot arbitrarily, capriciously, and unreasonably withhold its consent to transfer because that would be an unreasonable restraint on alienation.

Facts
Bertha Albares sold her condominium unit to Aquarian Foundation, Inc (Plaintiff), which was in violation of a provision of the declaration of condominium requiring the written consent of the Sholom House condominium association’s board of directors (Defendant) to any sale, lease, assignment or transfer of a unit owner’s interest. The declaration gave the association the power to arbitrarily, capriciously, or unreasonably withhold its consent to any sale. The declaration also had a reverter clause which mandates that the association compensate the unit owner if a transfer is done in violation of the consent requirement. Defendant sued to set aside the conveyance.

Issue
When a condominium association has the power to arbitrarily, capriciously, or unreasonably withhold its consent to transfer, does that constitute an unreasonable restraint on alienation even when a reverter clause exists?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
Apparently, a condominium association has the right to prevent a sale of a unit if it pays the unit owner the fair market value of the property.
