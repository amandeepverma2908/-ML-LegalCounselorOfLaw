692 S.W.2d 825, 1985 Mo. App. L.

Brief Fact Summary
A cable company installed cable wires on a property and was accused of violating an easement for telephone and electric lines.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Easements in gross are interpreted broadly in order to serve the primary goal of the easement.

Facts
Trustees of a subdivision (Plaintiffs) had the right to grant easements to other parties for the purpose of creating and maintaining electric, telephone and telegraphic service for the lots on the subdivision. Continental Cablevision (Defendant) used a license it received from two utility companies who serviced the subdivision, with easements granted by Plaintiffs, in order to erect cables, wires and conduits for the purpose of transmitting television shows. Plaintiffs seek an injunction.

Issue
Are the easements granted to utility companies exclusive, and therefore apportionable by the utilities to another utility company?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
When an easement in gross is exclusive (the grantor has no right to use the easement in conjunction with the grantee), the easement is considered apportionable because the grantee is not interfering with the grantorâ€™s rights.
