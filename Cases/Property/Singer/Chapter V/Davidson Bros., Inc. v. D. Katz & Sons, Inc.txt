Brief Fact Summary
A deed restricted the use of property as a supermarket, which negatively affected the city.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
If a covenant is contrary to public policy, it may not be enforced.

Facts
Davidson Bros., Inc. (Plaintiffs) owned supermarkets. At one time, he owned a supermarket in the inner city, which he had to close because its volume decreased. Plaintiffs sold the property to D. Katz & Sons, Inc. (Defendant), a rug merchant. A covenant in the deed stated that the property could not be used as a supermarket, and that the covenant ran with the land. Defendant then leased the property to the local Housing Authority that planned to use it as a supermarket because the neighborhood was in need of one. The residents did not have easy access to another supermarket because many did not have cars. Plaintiffs seek to enforce the covenant.

Issue
If a covenant is contrary to public policy, does it still have to be enforced?

Held
No.

Discussion
When a covenant is no longer reasonable and ends up hurting a community, it will not be enforced.
