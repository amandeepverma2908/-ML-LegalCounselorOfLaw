Brief Fact Summary
Owners of cabins on a ranch believed that they would have long-term occupancy of their residences. However, when ownership of the ranch changed, an attempt was made to terminate their licenses.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A constructive trust will be given to a party when there has been a breach of confidence that will wrongfully deprive the party of its rights and unjustly enrich the legal holder.

Facts
The owners of cabins (Appellants) located on the Rock Creek Lake front had been in the area since 1922, with the consent of the surrounding ranch. The construction has been built with the consent and help of the ranch owners. No written agreements were entered into between the ranch owners and cabin owners in the earlier years. In 1963, though, the cabin owners entered into license agreements with the ranch owners, which included a termination provision. Over the years, notice of termination was never served on the ranch owners, even though provisions of the license agreement had been breached by various cabin owners. The ranch was sold to a corporation (Appellees), who sent the cabin owners a notice of termination of their licenses, which was against the wishes of the original ranch owners. Appellants filed an action for interlocutory and permanent injunctive relief, and to quiet the title in their cabins and establish permanent easements.

Issue
When real property is held by a license agreement over several years, and the holders of the license make improvements and reasonably relies on the licensor’s promise that the license will be of a long duration, can that license be revoked at any time?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
The substantial expenditures on the land and the reliance on the licensor’s promise of a long-term license make the license irrevocable. But, the license is only irrevocable for the period of time necessary to protect the reliance interest.
