Brief Fact Summary
A landowner wanted to construct multi-family dwellings, but rezoning prevented him from doing so.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The standard for determining if a property owner has vested rights in a zoning classification includes the amount of construction accomplished prior to the rezoning.

Facts
Alex and Martha Stone (Plaintiffs) purchased undeveloped land with the intent of developing a low income, federally subsidized housing project. The project was to consist of several multi-family units. At the time of the purchase of the land, a quarter of the land was zoned as single-family residential and the rest was multi-family residential. Plaintiffs incurred expenses for the beginning stages of the planning of the project. The planning and zoning commission of the city recommended to the city council that the land should be rezoned as single-family residential due to alleged inadequacies of sewer, water, and electrical services. Plaintiffâ€™s application for a building permit was denied due to the pending recommendation, which was passed.

Issue
Does rezoning constitute a taking when only preliminary steps towards construction of property have taken place?

Held
No.

Discussion
A city needs to be able to rezone property in order to promote the welfare of the region. Even if this means that the construction plans of specific landowners will be affected and their intent in constructing can no longer be accomplished, the rezoning will be allowed to stand as long as the city is acting reasonably.
