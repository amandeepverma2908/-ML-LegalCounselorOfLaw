Brief Fact Summary
Landowners sought a variance to the zoning ordinance so they could sell their lot.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A variance may be granted where by reason of the extraordinary and exceptional situation of the property, the strict application of a zoning ordinance would result in exceptional and undue hardship upon the developer of the property.

Facts
A vacant lot is the only undeveloped property in a residential neighborhood, which consists of one and two family dwellings. Gordon and Helen Commons (Plaintiffs) are the owners. A builder contracted to buy the lot on the condition that he could construct a one-family residence on the lot. A variance from the townâ€™s zoning ordinance was necessary because the lot was undersized. The board of adjustment denied the variance because they found the application failed to demonstrate any evidence to establish hardship and that the granting of the variance would substantially impair the intent and purpose of the zoning plan of the town.

Issue
Does an undue hardship sufficient to grant a variance from a zoning ordinance exist when the hardship is unique to a particular lot in the neighborhood?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
A variance is a way for a landowner to escape a specific zoning ordinance. This is granted if a land regulation would cause an undue hardship to a particular landowner because of his unique circumstances. But, the variance must still allow for the substantial purpose of the land regulation to prevail, otherwise the zoning ordinance would be ineffective.
