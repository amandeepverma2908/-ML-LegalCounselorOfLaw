83 N.J. 309, 416 A.2d 388, 1980 N.J.

Brief Fact Summary
A restaurant converted to a nightclub, which was impermissible under a newly enacted zoning ordinance.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An existing nonconforming use can only continue of if it is a continuance of substantially the same kind of use as that which the premises were devoted at the time of the passage of the zoning ordinance. Nonconforming uses may not be enlarged except where the change is so negligible or insubstantial that it does not warrant judicial or administrative interference.

Facts
Parilloâ€™s (Defendant) operated a restaurant and catering service. The Town of Belleville (Plaintiff) passed an ordinance, which did not allow restaurants, but since Defendant existed before the ordinance was passed, they were allowed to remain in operation. Defendant made renovations and turned their property into a nightclub. They applied for a license, were rejected, and still operated the club. Plaintiff filed charges.

Issue
May the nonconforming use of property continue if it is not substantially the same kind of use as that to which the premises were devoted at the time of the passage of the relevant zoning ordinance?

Held
No.

Discussion
Nonconforming uses of property are inconsistent with the objective of uniform zoning. So, strict limitations are placed upon nonconforming uses.
