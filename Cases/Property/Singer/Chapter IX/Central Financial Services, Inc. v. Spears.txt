425 So. 2d 403, 1983 Miss.

Brief Fact Summary
A mortgage foreclosed on property, and then resold the property for a much higher price.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A sale of mortgaged property within twelve days of the foreclosure sale at a price two and one-half times the bid of the mortgage is so inadequate that it shocks the conscience.

Facts
Marshall Spears (Plaintiff) borrowed money from Central Financial Services, Inc. (Defendant) and executed a promissory note and a deed of trust to secure the debt. The loan became delinquent, so Defendant sold the property to itself at a foreclosure sale where they were the only bidders. Defendant then sold the property for two and a half times the amount they paid for it to a third party. Plaintiff moved to have the second sale set aside.

Issue
Is an inadequate sale price of real property sufficient to set aside the foreclosure sale if the price is so inadequate as to shock the conscience of the court?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
When the mortgagee sells property he foreclosed on at a price significantly different from the price at the foreclosure sale, he will be found to have not acted in good faith.
