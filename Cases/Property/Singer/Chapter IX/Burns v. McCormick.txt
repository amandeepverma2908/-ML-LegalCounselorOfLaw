Brief Fact Summary
A man orally promised a couple they could have his property upon his death if they took care of him.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Acts of part performance will not make an oral agreement affecting the rights in land enforceable unless the part performance was unequivocally referable to the alleged contract.

Facts
James Halsey (Halsey) was old man living alone. He told a couple (Plaintiffs) that if they gave up their home and business, lived with him, and cared for him during his life, the house and other property would be theirs when he died. They did as he asked, and he died five months after they moved in. No writing exists to authenticate this promise. Plaintiffs requested specific performance, and the estate defended with the statute of frauds.

Issue
Will an act of part performance be sufficient to enforce an oral agreement affecting rights in land?

Held
No.

Discussion
When a person seeks to enforce an oral promise, he must show that his part performance was in response to the contract and not based on another aspect of his relationship to the party.
