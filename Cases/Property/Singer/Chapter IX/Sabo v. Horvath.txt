Brief Fact Summary
This case involves two recorded interests, in which the second purchaser did not have notice of the prior recordation.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
If a grantor transfers prior to obtaining title, and the grantee records prior to title passing, a second grantee would not discover this conveyance, and so the second grantee is an innocent purchaser and his interest will prevail in a dispute over title.

Facts
Grover C. Lowery (Lowery) occupied land for the purpose of obtaining a patent. He issued a document entitled Quitclaim Deed to the Horvaths (Defendants). At that time, Defendants knew that the patent and title were still in the United States Government’s possession, however, they did not re-record their interest after the patent had passed to Lowery. Lowery was issued the patent after the deed was conveyed. After the patent was issued, he executed another quitclaim deed to the Sabos (Plaintiffs), who recorded the document.

Issue
Between two recorded interests, will the second purchaser who does not have notice of the previous recordation, which was outside the chain of title have the prevailing interest in the property?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
Under this rule, a party searching title does not have to check the records under a grantor’s name until the grantor actually receives title to the property. The title searcher is relieved of a large burden because it is easier for a party to rerecord an interest than to conduct an indefinite search.
