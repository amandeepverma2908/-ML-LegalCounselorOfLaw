Brief Fact Summary
The government condemned property on which a nonprofit summer camp was situated.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The fair market value, and not the replacement cost, will be used to determine just compensation for a taking of property, even when that property is used for the public good by a nonprofit organization.

Facts
Southeastern Pennsylvania Synod of the Lutheran Church in America (Respondent) operates three nonprofit summer camps. The United States (Plaintiff) began a condemnation proceeding to acquire the land for a public recreational project. Plaintiff offered Respondent the fair market value of the property. Respondents demanded the cost of developing functionally equivalent substitute facilitates at a new site.

Issue
Does just compensation require payment of replacement cost rather than fair market value of the property taken from a private nonprofit organization, which is used for a public purpose?

Held
No.

Discussion
Awarding the replacement cause instead of the fair market value rarely happens when deciding just compensation. If there is any way to determine fair market value without causing a large injustice to the owner, that sum will be used as just compensation for a taking.
