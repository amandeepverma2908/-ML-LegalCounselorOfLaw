Brief Fact Summary
Students wanted to distribute literature at a large shopping center, but the owners wanted to deny them access to the property.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A state law which requires owners of large shopping enters to allow members of the public to enter their property to distribute petitions does not constitute a taking of property, even though the law limits the property owner’s right to exclude others from its property.

Facts
PruneYard (Appellant) is a shopping center open to the public. It has a policy not to permit any visitor or tenant to engage in any publicly expressive activity, including the circulation of petitions, which is not directly related to its commercial purposes. High school students (Appellees) set up a table in a corner of Appellant’s courtyard and distributed pamphlets in support for their opposition to a United Nations resolution against Zionism. A security guard told them to leave. Appellees seek to enjoin Appellants from denying them access to the property to circulate their petitions. Appellants content that their constitutionally established rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to exclude Appellees from adverse use of their private property cannot be denied by invocation of a state constitutional provision or by judicial reconstruction of a state’s laws.

Issue
When a large shopping center is required to allow free expression and petition on its property, will that amount to a taking?

Held
No.

Discussion
The property in this case is open to the public, very large, and the physical invasion is only temporary and confined to a small area. The interest of the owners of the shopping center is small compared to the right of expression.
