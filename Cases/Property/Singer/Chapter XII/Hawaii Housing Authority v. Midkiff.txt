Brief Fact Summary
The land in a state was owned only by a handful of people, so the state sought to redistribute ownership.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When the exercise of the eminent domain power is rationally related to a conceivable public purpose, the act of the state will be valid.

Facts
Land in Hawaii remained in the hands of a few. To redress the problem, the legislature decided to compel the large landowners to break up their estates. They enacted legislation, which created a mechanism for condemning residential tracts and for transferring ownership of the condemned fee simple to existing lessees. The intent was to make the land sales involuntary, thereby making the federal tax consequences less severe while still facilitating the redistribution of fee simples. The state would transfer the land to the tenants living on them. Appellants seek to have the Act declared unconstitutional.

Issue
Is it valid for a state to use its eminent domain power to take land from one property owner and transfer it to another, if the purpose was to remedy inequality in land ownership?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
Even though the government never uses the land for itself, the transfer of property here falls under its eminent domain power. The state had a legitimate objective in redistributing land, so its act was justifiable under its police power.
