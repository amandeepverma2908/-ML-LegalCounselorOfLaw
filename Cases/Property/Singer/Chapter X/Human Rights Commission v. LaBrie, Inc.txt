Brief Fact Summary
A couple lived in a mobile home park with their baby. Eviction proceedings were commenced against them.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The state fair housing act prohibits discrimination in renting if a person intends to occupy a dwelling with minor children.

Facts
The Virginia Fair Housing and Public Accommodations Act (Act) prohibits discrimination against persons with minor children. Linda and Ernest LaBrie (Defendants) owned a mobile home park, which had a two-person occupancy limit. Scott and Luanne McCarthy purchased a mobile home and were childless at the time. After they had a baby, they received an eviction notice from Defendants. The McCarthys filed a complaint with the Human Rights Commission (Plaintiff), who commenced this action. Defendants claim the restriction is needed because of a limited water and septic capacity at the park.

Issue
Is a restriction against living in a mobile home park with children discriminatory?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
While there may be valid reasons for a landlord to exclude some children, a policy that prohibits any children will be found discriminatory.
