740 F. Supp. 95, 1990 U.S. Dist.

Brief Fact Summary
A town refused to allow an organization to build an AIDS hospice.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Fair Housing Act will be violated when a community refuses to allow construction of a group home for persons with disabilities, when the refusal is grounded in the fear of the community of those intending to reside in the home.

Facts
AFAPS (Plaintiffs) attempted to establish an AIDS hospice at a site. This was met with opposition by the town’s residents. The town was worried that mosquitoes might transmit AIDS, they did not want former drug users and homosexuals living in their town, and they worried about decreasing property values, among other things. Plaintiffs were not given a special permit for the operation of the hospice by ARPE (Defendants), a governmental agency. Plaintiffs allege a violation of the Fair Housing Act’s prohibition on discrimination on the basis of handicap. Defendants justify the refusal to grant the special permit because the area was limited to agricultural use.

Issue
Will the Fair Housing Act be violated when a permit is rejected because community residents are afraid of people with AIDS?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
Using zoning regulations as a pretext for excluding persons with AIDS from a town will be a violation of the Fair Housing Act because it will be discriminatory treatment with a disparate effect on a group with a handicap.
