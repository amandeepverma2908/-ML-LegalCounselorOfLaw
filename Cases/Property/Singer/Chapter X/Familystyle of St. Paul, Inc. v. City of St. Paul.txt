923 F.2d 91 (8th Cir. 1991)

Brief Fact Summary
An organization wanted to operate a group home for the mentally ill near other group homes.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A dispersal requirement in the operation of group homes for the mentally ill is valid under the Fair Housing Act (Act) because it is necessary to promote the mental health of the residents.

Facts
Familystyle of St. Paul, Inc. (Plaintiff) provides rehabilitative services to mentally ill persons and operates residential group homes for them. Plaintiff sought permits for additional houses. On the condition that Plaintiff would work to disperse its facilities, the city issued the temporary permits. Plaintiff failed to meet the conditions of the special use permits, and they expired. The city denied the renewal of the permits because the city requires that a new group home of the mentally ill be located at least a quarter of a mile from an existing residential program. Relying on the Act, Plaintiff challenges the actions of the city.

Issue
Is a requirement that group homes for the mentally ill be subject to spacing requirements valid under the Fair Housing Act?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
In upholding the spacing requirement, the court emphasizes that the requirement will help promote the mental health of the group home residents. They do not seem to be concerned with promoting integration in their decision.
