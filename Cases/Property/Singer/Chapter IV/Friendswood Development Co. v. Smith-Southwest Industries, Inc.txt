576 S.W.2d 21, 1978 Tex. 22 Tex. Sup. J. 107; 5 A.L.R.4th 591.

Brief Fact Summary
The defendant extracted a large amount of water from wells. Nearby landowners claimed these withdrawals caused their land to subside.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A landowner has an absolute interest in whatever water he can draw to the surface from his own property, even if the subsurface water is on someone else’s property and it damages other property.

Facts
The defendants withdrew large quantities of underground water form wells on their land. As a result, other land owned by plaintiffs severely subsided, causing erosion and floods.

Issue
Are landowners who withdraw underground water from wells located on their own land liable for damages that result on another’s land?

Held
No.

Dissent
The power to pump water is not the power to destroy the surface of surrounding landowners. The defendants have abused their right to withdraw water to the point that property rights of others are ignored and destroyed. An owner of land should be able to assert an action against one who destroys the lateral or subjacent support to his land in its natural state when either: (1) he engages in conduct knowing that it will cause damage to another’s land by loss or destruction of the subjacent support, (2) the plaintiff proves negligence, or (3) the plaintiff proves a nuisance.

Discussion
Under the English rule, as long as there is no malice, a landowner can remove so much water that another’s land falls, floods or erodes.
