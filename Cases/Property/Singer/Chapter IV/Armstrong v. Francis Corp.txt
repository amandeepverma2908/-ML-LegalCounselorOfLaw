Brief Fact Summary
A man changes the natural drainage pattern of a stream. Water from his property passes through a stream into another’s and erodes the other’s property.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Under the reasonable use doctrine, an owner may make only reasonable changes in the natural drainage pattern of surface water.

Facts
The defendant owns land upland from the plaintiff’s land. When the defendant’s land drains, the surface water goes into a small stream and crosses the plaintiff’s land. The defendant built a development and made large changes to the drainage system. Now, a huge amount of surface water passes into the stream. The plaintiff’s property begins to erode and flood, damaging his home.

Issue
When a person makes significant changes to the drainage flow of his property, and this change damages another’s property, is the person liable for the damage caused?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
The reasonable use doctrine is the middle ground between the common enemy rule and the civil law rule. The common enemy rule would result in one landowner ruining another owner’s land; the civil law rule would prevent a landowner from making his own land usable.
