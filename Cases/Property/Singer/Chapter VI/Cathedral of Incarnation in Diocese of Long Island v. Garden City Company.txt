Brief Fact Summary
A church could no longer support lands deeded to them and attempted to sell them pursuant to a bankruptcy proceeding.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The right of reentry cannot be assigned and will be void if an attempt to assign is made. Further, when a restriction in a deed becomes a burden and a financial drain on a landowner, the restriction will not be enforced.

Facts
The heirs of a woman sold to the Cathedral of the Incarnation in the Diocese of Long Island, Inc. (Plaintiff) real property. The deed restricted Plaintiff’s right to convey the property and stated that the premises were not to be used for anything other than religious or educational purposes. Garden City Company (Defendants) received an interest in the remaining property of the heirs. Plaintiff eventually filed for bankruptcy and entered into contracts to sell the land deeded to them by the heirs. Defendant claims that restrictions in Plaintiff’s deed created either a condition subsequent or a conditional limitation, so Defendant could enter the property and assert ownership. Judgment for Plaintiffs.

Issue
When a grantor creates a right of reentry, is that right void if the grantor tries to assign that right?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
This decision promotes the free alienability of land because the land is being put to its most beneficial use by being sold when the current owner can no longer maintain it.
