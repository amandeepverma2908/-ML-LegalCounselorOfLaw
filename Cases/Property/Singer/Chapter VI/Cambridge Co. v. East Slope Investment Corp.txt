Brief Fact Summary
A condominium declaration created a right of preemption (a right to purchase) in unit owners.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When preemptive rights do not threaten the free alienability of land, the rights will not be invalid under the rule against perpetuities.

Facts
A condominium declaration creates a right of preemption in unit owners, which is defined as having the first right to purchase a unit. This right states that when a unit owner decides to sell and receives a bona fide offer, the unit will first be offered to the remaining owners for the same terms and conditions as the bona fide offer. The unit owners have five days from the date of receiving notice of the offer to accept, otherwise the third party may buy the property.

Issue
When a condominium declaration allows unit owners to hold preemptive rights, will those rights violate the rule against perpetuities?

Held
No.

Discussion
A preemptive right that allows for purchase of a unit at market price is not subject to the rule against perpetuities because it does not impede the free alienability of the land. The purpose of the rule would not be served by applying the rule to this type of situation, so it is not applied
