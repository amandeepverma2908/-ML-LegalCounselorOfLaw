Brief Fact Summary
A grandfather conveyed property to his granddaughter, but in a way that did not fall in one of the traditional estates.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A person cannot create a new type of inheritance by will.

Facts
A will gave to a granddaughter and her heirs on her fatherâ€™s side property. She attempted to convey the property to another, but the party did not think she could convey a fee simple absolute.

Issue
When a testator puts words of limitation that restrict the descent of the property, will those limitations be valid?

Held
No.

Discussion
When a person tries to convey property in a way that does not conform to one of the traditional estates, the limitations in that conveyance will be invalid. This is to prevent restraints on alienation.
