128 Cal. App. 3d 536, 180 Cal. Rptr. 423, 1982 Cal. App.

Brief Fact Summary
American Indian remains were found at a site that was intended for a subdivision.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
American Indian burial grounds do not qualify as a cemetery entitled to protection from disinterment.

Facts
Community Construction, Inc. (Defendant) excavated property that was intended for a subdivision and uncovered human remains. The development of the property continued and Defendant uncovered the remains of over 200 human beings. The site still contains the remains of six or more persons. The burial ground had been used by the Miwok Indians and has been the subject of numerous archeological studies. Wana the Bear (Plaintiff), a direct descendant, brought suit to enjoin the further excavation and other desecration of the property.

Issue
Does the Indian burial ground achieve a protectable status as a public cemetery by virtue of its prior status as a public graveyard?

Held
No.

Discussion
The court offers no protection for American Indian burial sites. It seems as though the court is using technicalities of the cemetery codes to further property development, at the expense of American Indian burial grounds.
