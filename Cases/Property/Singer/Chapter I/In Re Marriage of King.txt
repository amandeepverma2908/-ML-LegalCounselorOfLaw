Brief Fact Summary
As a part of a divorce, the ex-wife was awarded the family home.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In Montana, child support considerations may be taken into account during an equitable division of property, and if the husband is unable to support the children, the wife may be granted a larger share of marital property in order to offset her increased financial obligation.

Facts
The Kings divorced in June 1981 in Montana. They had two minor children. The husband is employed as a professional gambler. The District Court awarded each their own personal property and gave the family home to the wife. The District Court found that the sale of the home would not provide adequate provision for the children, and the children would face a substantial hardship if they had to move.

Issue
When dividing property in a divorce case, is it proper for a court to take into account child support considerations?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
A division of property in a divorce proceeding should take into account the best interests of the children and may result in one party getting a larger share of the marital property.
