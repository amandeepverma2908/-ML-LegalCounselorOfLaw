Brief Fact Summary
Two non-Native American groups claimed title to land in Illinois.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Native Americans do not have title to land on which they live; they only have possession. Since they do not have title, they cannot convey title to others.

Facts
Johnson inherited a tract of land from his father, who bought the land from the Piankeshaw Indians. M’Intosh was later granted title from the United States government. Johnson and M’Intosh filed an action for ejectment.

Issue
Do Native Americans possess title to their land?

Held
No.

Discussion
Chain of title begins with the United States government because of the conquest of America by Europeans. Native Americans only have a right to live on the land.
