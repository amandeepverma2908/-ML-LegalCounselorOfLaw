Brief Fact Summary
An amateur archeologist excavated American Indian artifacts from burial plots on land which he did not own. He attempted to sell the collection, but could not prove ownership of the artifacts.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Objects found in burial plots are not abandoned property; instead, they belong to the descendants and cannot be acquired over the objection of the descendants.

Facts
Charrier is an amateur archaeologist, and he found an area which was once the site of an American Indian village. He spent three years excavating the site and excavated a large amount of artifacts, even though he knew he did not have permission from the landowner. Because he was unable to prove ownership over the artifacts, he could not sell the collection. He sought a judgment declaring himself the owner of the artifacts, or in the alternative, compensation under the theory of unjust enrichment for his time and expenses. The trial court denied both claims.

Issue
When a person expends a large amount of time and money excavating buried cultural objects, do those objects belong to him?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
Objects buried with the dead belong to the deceasedâ€™s ancestors and are not abandoned property. If they are excavated by a third party without permission of the owners, the third party is not entitled to any unjust enrichment
