Brief Fact Summary
After a well blew out, neighboring gas and oil escaped underground.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The negligent waste and destruction of a person’s gas and oil will permit that person to recover damages because he has been deprived of his rights in that property.

Facts
Mabel and Frank Elliff (Petitioners) own a parcel of land upon a producing well. They had a royalty interest in oil and gas leases on their land. Clara Driscoll owned the land adjoining theirs. Texon Drilling Co. (Respondents) were drilling on Driscoll’s property, near Petitioners land. During drilling, a well blew out, causing wells on Plaintiffs land to blow out. The first blow out also caused large quantities of gas and oil to drain from under Petitioner’s land and escape into the air.

Issue
Will a party be liable for the negligent waste or destruction of another’s oil and gas when that waste and destruction occurred after the minerals had been drained from beneath the person’s land?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
Negligently wasting natural resources deprives a person of his property rights in those resources, including the right to profit from them. So, the waster should compensate the injured party for his loss.
