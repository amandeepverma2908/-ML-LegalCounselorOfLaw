232 U.S. 340, 34 S. Ct. 415, 58 L. Ed. 631, 1914 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
In a negligence action, Leroy Fibre Company (Plaintiff) claimed that Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway (Defendant) had destroyed his property and sought damages. A jury found for the Defendant. Plaintiff sought review.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An owner of property who acts in a reasonable and prudent manner has a right to manage his property as he sees fit without being required to anticipate another’s negligence.

Facts
Plaintiff owned land adjacent to Defendant’s railroad. In connection with Plaintiff’s business, he stacked flax on the property. He brought an action against the railroad, alleging that Defendant’s negligence caused sparks and colas emitted from the railway to ignite the flax and it was destroyed. The closest of the stacks was seventy-five feet from the railway. Defendant argued contributory negligence, claiming Plaintiff had stacked the flax too close to the railway.

Issue
Did the Plaintiff’s action of stacking flax adjacent to the railway constitute evidence of negligence and should thus be submitted to a jury?

Held
No. The court held that an owner of property who acts in a reasonable and prudent manner has a right to manage his property as he sees fit without being required to anticipate another’s negligence.

Discussion
The question presented in Leroy Fibre illustrates a common tension that arises with regard to liability that property law, with its emphasis on ownership rights, may conflict with negligence law, with its emphasis on safety.
