7 N.J.Misc. 337, 145 A. 476 (1929).

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff, tenant Rush (Plaintiff), was injured when she fell through the floor of a detached privy. Plaintiff won a suit against the Defendant landlord, Commercial Realty Co. (Defendant). The Defendant appealed.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Implied assumption of the risk is applicable only when a plaintiff voluntarily encounters a known risk.

Facts
Plaintiff was a tenant of the Defendant. The rented premises had a detached privy for the use of two houses. Plaintiff went to the privy and fell through the floor or through a trap door therein. Plaintiff fell nine feet into the accumulation at the bottom and had to be removed with the use of a ladder. Defendant appeals the trial court verdict, claiming that it erred in refusing a nonsuit and erred in refusing to direct a verdict for the Defendant.

Issue
Did the trial court err by not directing a verdict in favor of the Defendant based on Plaintiffâ€™s contributory negligence or assumption of the risk?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
Assumption of the risk requires actual knowledge of a particular risk, appreciation of its magnitude and voluntarily encountering the risk.
