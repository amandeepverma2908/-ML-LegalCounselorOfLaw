86 Wis. 2d 129, 271 N.W.2d 676 (1978)

Brief Fact Summary
The Circuit Court for Washburn County (Wisconsin) directed a verdict for Hartford Casualty Ins. Co. (Defendant) in the patient’s medical malpractice action. Plaintiff appealed.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An application of the res ipsa loquitur doctrine based on common knowledge is allowed only when the occurrence clearly speaks for itself.

Facts
Kelly (Plaintiff), a seventy-five year-old woman, entered a Wisconsin hospital in July, 1975, complaining of lower back pain.
