Brief Fact Summary
Patricia Cohen and her husband (Plaintiffs), filed suit against Robert Smith, nurse, and St. Joseph’s Memorial Hospital (Defendants) in the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Illinois) after Smith observed and touched her naked body in violation of her religious beliefs. The complaints alleged battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and violation of the Right of Conscience Act, 745 Ill. Comp. Stat. 70/2 (1992). The court granted Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss.

The decision was reversed and the case remanded.

Discussion
As noted in Snyder v. Turk, “A person may be held liable for battery when he or she intends to cause harmful or offensive contact and harmful or offensive contact results.” Further, courts have drawn fine distinctions between conduct that results in bodily harm and conduct that violates a plaintiff’s personal integrity. The court notes that the “application of battery the remedy offensive and insulting conduct is deeply ingrained in our legal history.” Specifically with regard to religious beliefs and medical treatment, the court observed that, while people in modern society generally accept the various intrusions on one’s privacy as a necessity, the determination of bodily integrity is ultimately the purview of the person alleging improper contact. The court in Cohen v. Smith concluded also: “The fact that the Plaintiffs hold deeply ingrained religious beliefs which are not shared by the majority of society does not mean that those beliefs deserve less protection than mo
