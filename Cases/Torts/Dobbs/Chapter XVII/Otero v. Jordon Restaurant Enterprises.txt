Brief Fact Summary
The District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico) granted pre-trial partial summary judgment to Plaintiff in his action for injuries sustained on the premises of a restaurant and refused to give certain comparative negligence instructions to the jury. Jordan Restaurant Enterprises (Defendant) appealed the rulings.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A premises owner who entrusts to an independent contractor construction, repair, or other work on the land, or on a building or other structure upon it, is subject to the same liability as though he had retained the work in his own hands to others on or outside of the land for physical harm caused to them by the unsafe condition of the structure after he has resumed possession of the land upon its completion.

Under the concept of ‘collateral negligence,’ an employer of an independent contractor, unless he is himself negligent, is not liable for physical harm caused by any negligence of the contractor if (1) the contractor’s negligence consists solely in the improper manner in which he does the work; and (2) it creates a risk of such harm which is not inherent in or normal to the work; and (3) the employer had no reason to contemplate the contractor’s negligence when the contract was made. In this instance, Defendant was not shielded by the doctrine. The concept of collateral negligence is limited to negligence that pr
