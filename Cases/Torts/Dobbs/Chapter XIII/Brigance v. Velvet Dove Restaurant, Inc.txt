Brief Fact Summary
In a negligence action, Plaintiffs seek damages against Velvet Dove Restaurant, Inc. (Defendant) alleging that Defendant served alcohol to clearly intoxicated persons. The District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma) dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs appealed.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
One who sells intoxicating beverages for on the premises consumption has a duty to exercise reasonable care not to sell liquor to a noticeably intoxicated person.

Facts
Defendant served alcohol to a group of minors that included Jeff Johnson (Johnson), who the Defendant knew had driven the group to the restaurant. Plaintiffs alleged that the alcohol Defendant served to Johnson either caused his intoxication, or contributed to his incumbent state of intoxication that caused a one-car accident in which Plaintiff was injured. Plaintiff brought suit. The trial court dismissed the claim.

Issue
Did the former common law rule shielding bars and restaurants that serve alcohol from civil liability apply?

Held
No. Noting that the former common law rule was an anachronism and unrealistic within the framework of modern tort law, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, discarded it, overturning the lower courts’ decisions.

Discussion
The court in Brigance, noting the change in the trend of tort law with respect to alcohol consumption and driving, and those who provide alcohol, observed “duty and liability are matters of public policy . . . subject to the changing attitudes and needs of society.” Thus, the court, while noting that the Legislature had not spoken directly to the subject of liability under the kinds of circumstances in question, nevertheless saw fit to “establish a civil cause of action by an injured third person against a commercial vendor of liquor for on the premises consumption.”
