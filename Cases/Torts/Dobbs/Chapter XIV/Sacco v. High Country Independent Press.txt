271 Mont. 209, 52 State Rptr. 407, 896 P.2d 411, 10 IER Cases 1041 (1995)

Brief Fact Summary
The District Court of the Eighteenth Judicial District, in and for the County of Gallatin (Montana) granted summary judgment to Defendants, the employer and officers, on claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. Section: 1983 and negligent emotional distress against the officers, and on a defamation claim against the employer.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Government officials performing discretionary functions are shielded from liability for civil damages only where their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have knowledge.

Facts
Plaintiff alleged in her complaint that when she left employment with High Country Independent Press (Defendant), company officers and stockholders falsely claimed that she had committed theft of private documents. Plaintiff instituted, among other causes of action, a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

Issue
Did the particulars alleged in the complaint justify the adoption of negligent infliction of emotional distress as an independent cause of action?

Held
The court reversed and remanded the lower court’s grant of summary judgment. The court, joining other jurisdictions, recognized negligent infliction of emotional distress as an independent cause of action.

Discussion
The Supreme Court of Montana constructed a fresh legal framework in adopting negligent infliction of emotional distress as an independent cause of action, recognizing a need to enunciate a clear standard. Negligent infliction of emotional distress occurs when serious or severe emotional distress to the plaintiff was the reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant’s negligent act.
