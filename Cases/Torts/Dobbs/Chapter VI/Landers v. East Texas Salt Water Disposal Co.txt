242 S.W.2d 236, 1951 Tex. App.

Brief Fact Summary
: Landers (Plaintiff), owner of a small lake, appealed the dismissal of action as to damages. After East Texas Salt Water Disposal Company’s (Defendant) plea in abatement asserting a misjoinder of parties and of causes of action had been sustained, the lake owner declined to replead so as to assert several liability only against each defendant in separate suits. The Court of Civil Appeals for the Sixth District (Texas) affirmed.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
This case overrules the holding in Sun Oil Co. v. Robicheaux when it was held that a plaintiff could not proceed to judgment and satisfaction against the wrongdoers separately because in such a suit he cannot discharge the burden of proving with sufficient certainty the portion of the injury attributable to each defendant.

Facts
Plaintiff owned a small lake, which he had cleaned and stocked with fish at considerable expense. He alleged that East Texas Salt Water Disposal Co. and Sun Oil Co. (Defendants) both caused large quantities of salt water and also oil to flow into his lake killing the fish. He alleged that both Defendants acted negligently.

Issue
Did the Plaintiff in his pleading allege facts, which, if established by evidence, made the Defendants jointly and severally liable for Plaintiff’s damages?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
The Plaintiffs’ action seeking a joint and several judgment of damages and injunctive relief was dismissed as to the damages feature by the trial court, when, after Defendants’ plea in abatement asserting a misjoinder of parties and of causes of action had been sustained, he declined to replead so as to assert several liability only against each of the Defendants in separate suits.
