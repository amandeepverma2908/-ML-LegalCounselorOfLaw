266 Or. 427, 513 P.2d 1167 (1973)

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff, Zimmerman (Plaintiff), obtained a $7,500 jury verdict for damages incurred during an automobile accident caused by the Defendant, Ausland (Defendant). These damages included a permanent injury based on torn cartilage, preventing Plaintiff from engaging in strenuous physical education activities.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In order to recover for permanent injuries, a plaintiff has a duty to mitigate those damages by submitting to treatment that would cure the damages if a reasonable person would do so under the same circumstances.

Facts
Plaintiff was injured during an automobile accident caused by the negligence of Defendant. Plaintiff obtained a jury verdict for $7,500, including damages for permanent injury based on torn semilunar cartilage in her knee. The jury found that she would no longer be able to engage in the strenuous physical education activities she had previously engaged in during her work as a substitute teacher.

Issue
Did the trial court err by submitting to the jury the issue of whether plaintiff sustained a permanent injury and in instructing the jury on plaintiffâ€™s life expectancy based on Standard Mortality Tables?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
The duty to mitigate is not a true duty, but actually a rule that does not allow recovery of damages the plaintiff could have avoided.
