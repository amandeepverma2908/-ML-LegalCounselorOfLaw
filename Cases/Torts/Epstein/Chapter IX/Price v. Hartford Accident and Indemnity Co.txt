108 Ariz. 485, 502 P.2d 522 (1972).

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff, Charles Price (Plaintiff), was sued for punitive damages resulting from an accident caused by a drag race. The Defendant, Plaintiff’s insurance company, Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co. (Defendant), claimed that it was not responsible for the punitive damage claim based on public policy considerations.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In Arizona, public policy does not make insurance policies void that promise to pay all sums, including punitive damages.

Facts
Gary Gardner was injured as a result of a drag race between the Plaintiff and another individual. Gardner brought suit against Plaintiff for $100,000 in compensatory and $25,000 in punitive damages. The Defendant, Plaintiff’s liability insurance company, claimed that it had no duty to defend or indemnify him for the punitive damage claim. Plaintiff’s policy with Defendant had a $1,000,000 limit and promised to pay for all sums he might become liable to pay. Plaintiff and his mother sought a declaratory judgment that the policy included punitive damages coverage. The trial court found against the Plaintiff, and Plaintiff appeals.

Issue
Was the trial court correct in determining that the public policy of the state makes the insurance contract illegal as it relates to punitive damages?

Discussion
Modern American jurisdictions are split on the issue discussed in this
