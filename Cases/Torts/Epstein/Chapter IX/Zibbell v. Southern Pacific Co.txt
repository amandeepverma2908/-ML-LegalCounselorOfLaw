Brief Fact Summary
There are no facts in the casebook.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Money awarded as damages to a party does not necessarily compensate for the physical injury suffered.

Facts
There are no facts in the casebook.

Issue
Are the damages awarded to a party equal to the amount that the party was physically injured?

Held
No.

Discussion
The excerpt included in the casebook attempts to make the point that a roomful of gold is not sufficient to equally compensate a party that has been physically injured. However, the legal amount of money in an award for money damages is not all the money in the world, even when it would take all the money in the world to fully compensate the injured party.
