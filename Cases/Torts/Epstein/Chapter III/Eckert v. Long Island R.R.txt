Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff was hit and killed by Long Island R.R.’s (Defendant’s) train in an attempt to rescue a child who was on the train tracks. Defendant moved for a nonsuit upon the ground that Plaintiff’s negligence contributed to the injury.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Negligence implies some act of commission or omission wrongful in itself. Plaintiff will not be held to be negligent in rescuing a child.

Facts
Plaintiff was standing about fifty feet from Defendant’s railroad track in the afternoon of the day. A child, three or four years old was sitting or standing upon Defendant’s railroad track as the train was approaching. The train was likely to run the child over if Plaintiff, seeing the danger, had not rescued child. Plaintiff threw the child clear of the track, but continuing across the track himself, was struck by the train and died. Defendant moved for a nonsuit upon the ground that it appeared that Plaintiff’s negligence contributed to the injury. The lower court denied Defendants request and the jury found a verdict for Plaintiff. Defendant appealed

Issue
Is Plaintiff negligent and thus barred from recovery when he puts himself at peril to save the life of a child?

Held
No. Judgment for Plaintiff affirmed.

Dissent
Plaintiff went upon the track in front of an approaching train voluntarily. His action was the result of his own choice. No one can maintain an action for a wrong when he consents or contributes to the act, which occasions his loss. One who with liberty of choice, and knowledge of the hazard of injury, places himself in the position of danger, does so at his own peril, and must take the consequences of his act.

Discussion
A high value is placed on the preservation of human life and the court will not negate the Plaintiff’s claim of negligence.
