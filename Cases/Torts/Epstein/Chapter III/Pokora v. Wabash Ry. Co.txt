Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff was killed while attempting to cross Wabash Ry. Co.’s (Defendant’s) four railroad tracks. Plaintiff did not get out of his vehicle to obtain a better view as required by the opinion in Baltimore & Ohio R.R. v. Goodman.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
To get out of a vehicle is uncommon precaution, as everyday experience informs us. The actions of a plaintiff depend on the situation and the circumstances, and it is up to the jury to decide whether a particular course of action was reasonable.

Facts
Defendant had four railroad tracks. Plaintiff, in his vehicle, attempted to cross the tracks. Plaintiff could not see the main track because a boxcar on the first track obstructed his view. Plaintiff stopped and listened for a bell or whistle but did not hear either. Plaintiff did not get out of his vehicle to obtain a better view as the opinion in Baltimore & Ohio R.R. v. Goodman seemed to require. The trial court directed a verdict for Defendant on its finding that Plaintiff had been contributory negligent. Defendant appealed.

Issue
Is there a duty for Plaintiff to stop, exit the vehicle, look and listen before crossing a railroad track?

Held
No. Judgment reversed.

Discussion
The jury gets to decide whether or not Plaintiff is required to get out of his vehicle and look for trains. There is no standard requiring that Plaintiff always get out and look and listen for a train each time he comes upon a track, because that is uncommon conduct.
