Synopsis of Rule of Law
A boxing promoter is liable for the boxers’ injuries in an unlicensed boxing match, regardless of whether or not the boxers consented.

Facts
Plaintiff brought suit against Defendant for injuries sustained in an unlicensed boxing match. Defendant was conducting a carnival where one of the concessions consisted of boxing exhibitions. These boxing exhibitions were in violation of section 412 of the Penal Code and the Business and Professions Code (chap. 2 div. 8), because prizes and prize money was given to boxing contestants and no license had been obtained. Defendant offered Plaintiff $5 to engage in a boxing match. Plaintiff suffered personal injuries as the result of being struck by his opponent. Plaintiff was 18 years old. Plaintiff brought suit against Defendant to recover for the injuries he sustained. The lower court ordered a judgment of dismissal, because of Plaintiff’s failure to amend their complaint, after a demurrer was sustained with leave to amend. Plaintiff appealed.

Issue
Is an unlicensed boxing promoter liable for the injuries of the boxers in the boxing match regardless of the rights and consent of the boxers?

Held
Yes. Judgment reversed.

Discussion
In this case Plaintiff’s consent did not release Defendant from liability because Defendant did not obtain a license and was in violation of the rules and regulations pertaining to boxing matches. Defendant is liable for the injuries sustained by Plaintiff as a matter of public policy. Public policy protects Plaintiff, a boxer, from the inability to appreciate the consequences of a boxing match.
