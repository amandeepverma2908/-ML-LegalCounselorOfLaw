Brief Fact Summary
Courvoisier (Defendant), a jewelry storeowner, shot Raymond (Plaintiff), a police officer, because Defendant believed his life was in danger.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Defendant shot Plaintiff during a riot. Defendant swears that he thought Plaintiff, a police officer, to be a rioter who was approaching him in a threatening attitude.

Facts
Defendant was asleep in the second story of a building. He occupied a portion of the lower floor of this building as a jewelry store. Parties shaking or trying to open the door of the jewelry store woke Defendant up. These parties insisted on being admitted into the jewelry store. Upon Defendant’s refusal, the parties broke some signs and entered the building through another entrance. The parties knocked on the door where Defendant’s sister was sleeping. Defendant grabbed his gun and chased the parties out of the building. In order to frighten the parties, Defendant fired a warning shot in the air. The parties were not scared and threw bricks at Defendant. Defendant fired more warning shots. The first warning shot attracted Plaintiff, a police officer. Plaintiff approached Defendant, calling out to him that he was a police officer and to stop shooting. It was dark but the street was well lighted. Defendant took aim of Plaintiff and fired, causing injury to Plaintiff. Plaintiff

Issue
During a riot, is one justified in shooting another in an act of self-defense if he believes the other person to be one of the rioters?

Held
Yes. Judgment reversed.

Discussion
Self-defense is universally recognized as a justification for intentionally inflicting harm. In this case, the jury instruction did not allow the jury to fully consider Defendant’s version of the shooting.
