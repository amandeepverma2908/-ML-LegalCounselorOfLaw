Discussion
Threats of some future harm are insufficient to constitute the tort of assault. An assault is the act of putting another person in reasonable fear or apprehension of an immediate battery by means of an act amounting to an attempt or threat to commit a battery. In this case, Defendant put his hand on this sword. The act requirement of a claim for assault has been satisfied. The reason why Defendant is not liable to Plaintiff for assault in this case is because of the words spoken by Defendant to Plaintiff. Defendant’s statement did not reflect an immediate attack. His words implied an attack in the future, it at all. Assault requires an immediate apprehension of a battery. In this case, Defendant did not express a wish or intent to commit an immediate battery. Thus Plaintiff may not maintain an action against Defendant for assault.
