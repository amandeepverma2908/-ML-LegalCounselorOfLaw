Brief Fact Summary
Stepp (Defendant) entered onto Dougherty’s (Plaintiff’s) land to claim a portion of it as his own. No actual physical damage was done to Plaintiff’s land.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Every unauthorized entry onto the land of another is a trespass.

Facts
Plaintiff brought an action of trespass quarum clausum freigit against Defendant. Trespass to real property was traditionally called trespass quarum clausum freigit.

Issue
Is Defendant liable for an unauthorized and unlawful entry onto Plaintiff’s land even if Defendant’s entry causes no actual physical damage?

Held
Yes. Judgment reversed. New trial granted.

Discussion
The requisite intent to maintain an action for trespass is merely the intent to enter the land. An honest mistake or belief that the land belongs to the trespasser will not relieve Defendant of liability. In this case, Defendant is strictly liable for the trespass regardless of his intent or negligence. Defendant will compensate Plaintiff for the trespass even if there is no physical damage to Plaintiff’s land. In this case, Plaintiff can possibly recover a small amount in money damages or obtain an injunction.
