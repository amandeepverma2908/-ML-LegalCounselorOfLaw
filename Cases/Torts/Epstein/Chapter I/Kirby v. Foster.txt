298 F.3d 219.

Brief Fact Summary
Foster (Defendant) used force to retake money from Kirby (Plaintiff). Plaintiff peacefully took money entrusted to him because he honestly believed that the money was due to him.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The right of recapture of chattels involves two things: first, possession by the owner, and, second, a purely wrongful taking or conversion, without a claim of right.

Facts
Plaintiff worked as a bookkeeper for Providence Warehouse Co. (Corporation), of which Defendant was the agent. The Corporation lost fifty dollars. Plaintiff was held responsible and fifty dollars was deducted from Plaintiffâ€™s pay. Defendant handed Plaintiff some money to pay the employees. Plaintiff took from this money an amount due to him, including the fifty dollars, and returned the balance to Defendant. Defendant and his son grabbed Plaintiff in an attempt to retake the money. A struggle ensued and Plaintiff was injured for which suit was brought. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Plaintiff. Defendant appealed.

Issue
Were Defendants justified in the use of force upon Plaintiff to retake money from him?

Held
No. Judgment for Plaintiff.

Discussion
The self-help remedy of recapture of chattels is allowed when one person wrongfully obtained the possession by either force or fraud, or without claim of right. Any privilege of recapture must be exercised promptly (the hot pursuit requirement) or else the privilege will be lost.
