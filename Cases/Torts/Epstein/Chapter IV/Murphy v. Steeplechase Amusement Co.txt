Brief Fact Summary
A young man (Plaintiff) was injured on Steeplechase Amusement Co.’s (Defendant’s) amusement park ride, “The Flopper.” Plaintiff sued Defendant for negligence.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
One who takes part in a sport accepts the dangers that are inherent in it so far as they are obvious and necessary.

Facts
Defendant maintains an amusement park. “The Flopper” is an attraction at Defendant’s park. It consists of a moving belt, running upward on an inclined plane, on which passengers sit or stand. Many patrons are unable to keep their footing because of the movement of the belt and are thrown backwards or aside. Plaintiff visited Defendant’s park and stepped upon the moving belt of “The Flopper.” As he did so, he felt what he describes as a sudden jerk, and was thrown to the floor. His wife in front of him and friends behind him were thrown at the same time. Plaintiff suffered a fractured kneecap. Plaintiff sued Defendant for negligence. In his claim for negligence, Plaintiff argued that the belt was dangerous to life and limb in that it stopped and started violently and suddenly and was not properly equipped to prevent injuries to people who were using it without knowledge of its dangers. Plaintiff also argued that “The Flopper” was operated at a fast and dangerous speed and shoul

Issue
Is Defendant (an amusement park) liable for damages to Plaintiff who is hurt on a ride when it is reasonably foreseeable that some danger is involved?

Held
No. Judgment reversed. New trial granted.

Discussion
In this case, Plaintiff assumed the risk of a sudden jerk when he stepped on the moving belt of “The Flopper.” It was fairly obvious what the ride entailed and there were no hidden surprises. Plaintiff assumed the risk of a sudden jerk. Defendant is not liable to Plaintiff on a theory of negligence for an obvious and necessary sudden jerk.
