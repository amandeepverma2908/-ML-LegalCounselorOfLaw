Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff was injured when the truck he was driving was rear-ended by a 1978 GMC two-ton chasis-cab. Plaintiff brought suit against General Motors Corp. (Defendant) on a theory of strict liability, as the manufacturer of the truck.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A manufacturer cannot be held strictly liable for the danger caused by one of its products, if it does not cause the defect in the product.

Facts
Plaintiff was injured when his pickup was hit from behind by a chasis-cab that had been equipped with a water tank, after sale, by the Defendant dealership. Plaintiff brought suit against Defendant under a theory of strict liability, and products liability, maintaining that the product, which had been placed into the stream of commerce, was unreasonably dangerous because of both manufacturing and design defects. At the trial in this matter, the jury reached a verdict for Defendant, and Plaintiff appealed.

Issue
Whether strict liability is a proper manufacturing defect theory?

Held
Reversed and remanded.
