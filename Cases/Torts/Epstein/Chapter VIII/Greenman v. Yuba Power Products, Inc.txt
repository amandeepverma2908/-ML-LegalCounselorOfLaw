Citation
59 Cal. 2d 57, 377 P.2d 897,27 Cal. Rptr. 697, 1963 Cal.

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff, William Greenman (Plaintiff), was injured when his Shopsmith combination power tool threw a piece of wood, striking him in the head. Plaintiff sued and the Defendant, Yuba Power Products, Inc. (Defendant) the manufacturer, defended claiming that Plaintiff’s breach of warranty claim was barred due to his failure to give timely notice.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Individuals injured by products with design or manufacturing defects may bring suit under strict liability regardless of a failure to give timely notice to the manufacturer for a breach of warranty.

Facts
The Plaintiff saw a Shopsmith combination power tool demonstrated by a retailer and he studied a brochure prepared by the manufacturer. His wife bought him a Shopsmith, and Plaintiff bought necessary attachments to use the Shopsmith as a lathe. After working with the lathe several times without difficulty, it suddenly threw the piece of wood he was working with out of the machine, striking him in the head inflicting serious injuries. Approximately ten and one-half months later, Plaintiff gave the retailer and the manufacturer written notice of claimed breaches of warranties and filed a complaint alleging said breaches and negligence.

Issue
Is Plaintiff’s action based on representations contained in the brochure barred against the manufacturer due to a failure to give timely notice?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
The Court in this case finds that an apparently applicable statute will not bar recovery. Many of the products liability decisions tend to insure the protection of the consumer over that of manufacturers.
