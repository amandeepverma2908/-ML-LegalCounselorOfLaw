94 N.J. 169, 463 A.2d 298, 1983 N.J.

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff, Gary O’Brien (Plaintiff), was injured when he dove into an above ground pool designed and manufactured by the Defendant, Muskin Corp. (Defendant). Plaintiff brought suit claiming that Defendant was strictly liable for the defectively designed pool.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Based on risk utility analysis, a defendant may be liable for a design defect even if his product complied with the existing level of technological advances at the time of design.

Facts
Plaintiff arrived uninvited at the home of Arthur and Jean Henry and dove into their above ground pool made by Defendant. As Plaintiff’s hands hit the vinyl lined pool bottom, they slid apart and Plaintiff sustained injuries when his head hit the bottom. The water in the pool was filled to a depth of approximately three and one-half feet and a warning decal saying Do Not Dive appeared beneath the manufacturer’s logo in letters approximately one-half inch high. Plaintiff claimed that Defendant was strictly liable for manufacturing and marketing a defectively designed pool, specifically because of the slippery quality of the lining and inadequate warnings. The trial court limited the jury’s consideration to the adequacy of the warning.

Issue
Did the trial court err by not permitting the jury to determine if the risks of injury associated with the pool so outweighed the utility of the product as to constitute a defect?

Held
Yes. Judgment reversed and remanded.

Dissent
Justice Schreiber’s concurring and dissenting opinion omitted.

Discussion
The majority of jurisdictions today use some form of risk utility analysis in design defect cases.
