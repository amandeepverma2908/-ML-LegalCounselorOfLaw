166 Vt. 548, 701 A.2d 1044, 1997 Vt.

Brief Fact Summary
Clodgo (Plaintiff) was hurt while involved in horseplay at work. Plaintiff sought an award of workers’ compensation.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An accident occurs in the course of employment when it was within the period of time the employee was on duty at a place where the employee was reasonably expected to by while fulfilling the duties of the employment contract.

Facts
Plaintiff was working as a manager of Defendant’s store. During a lull between customers, Plaintiff began firing staples with a staple gun at a coworker who was sitting on a couch watching TV. The coworker protested and after 30 or so staples were fired at him, he fired three staples back at Plaintiff. One of the three staples hit Plaintiff’s eye. Plaintiff filed a workers’ compensation claim. Plaintiff was awarded money. Defendant appealed.

Issue
Did Plaintiff’s horseplay bar him from recovery for the resulting injury under Vermont’s Workers’ Compensation Act?

Held
Yes. Judgment reversed.

Dissent
(Justice Morse) The court has second-guessed the Commissioner’s conclusions rather than doing its duty to affirm the judgment if the facts fairly and reasonably support it.

Discussion
In this case, the key inquiry is whether the employee deviated too far from his or her duties. It is important to consider (1) the extent and seriousness of the deviation; (2) the completeness of the deviation; (3) the extent to which the activity had become an accepted part of the employment; and (4) the extent to which the nature of the employment may be expected to include some horseplay.
