360 Mass. 1, 271 N.E.2d 592, 1971 Mass.

Brief Fact Summary
Pinnick (Plaintiff) claimed that a state no-fault statute unconstitutionally deprived his right to full recovery in tort.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A no-fault insurance statute that limits an award for pain and suffering is constitutional if it bears a rational relation to a legitimate legislative objective and provides a reasonable substitution for prior rights.

Facts
Plaintiff was injured in an automobile accident. He claimed that the accident was caused by Cleary (Defendant), who was negligent. Plaintiff sued Defendant in common law, seeking damages above and beyond what was allowed by the Massachusetts no-fault statute. Defendant used the no-fault statute as an affirmative defense. Plaintiff then brought a bill in equity to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachussetts, claiming that the statute unconstitutionally deprived him of “his right to full recovery in tort.”

Issue
Is the no-fault insurance statute unconstitutional because it limits the amount that Plaintiff can recover in a suit for negligence?

Held
No. Judgment for Defendant.

Discussion
No-fault automobile legislation is constitutional.
