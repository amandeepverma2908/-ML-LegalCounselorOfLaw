Brief Fact Summary
After the tragedy of September 11, 2001, Congress and the President enacted the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund (Fund) of 2001 to provide compensation to the bereaved. Plaintiffs brought suit claiming that the Fund unconstitutionally discriminates against them

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The duty of a judge is to give deference to the Department of Justice’s regulations and respect to the Special Master’s policies to the extent that they are rooted in law.

Facts
More than 3,000 people died on September 11, 2001 for terrorist-related aircraft crashes into the World Trade Center towers. Eleven days later, Congress and the President enacted the Fund to provide compensation to the bereaved. Plaintiffs, who are eligible to file claims with the Victim Compensation Fund, but have not yet done so, allege that the regulations promulgated by the Department of Justice and the interpretive polices of the Special Master, Feinburg (Defendant), violate the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (Act), and unconstitutionally discriminate against them. Their central allegation is that Defendant’s proposed awards fail to reflect that money who died in the World Trade Center were earning, and would have continued earn, much more than the Special Master is prepared to recognize.

Issue
Did the Special Master, Feinburg (Defendant) discriminate against Plaintiffs by failing to award Plaintiffs more money in administering the Fund?

Held
No. Defendant’s Summary Judgment Motion was granted.
