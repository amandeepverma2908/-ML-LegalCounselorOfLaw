168 So. 2d 317, 1964 Fla.

Brief Fact Summary
Fontainebleau Hotel Corp. (Defendant) maliciously began to build an addition to his hotel, which blocked the air and light to Plaintiff’s neighboring hotel.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
There is no common law easement for air-flow or light

Facts
Defendant was in the process of building a fourteen-story addition to their hotel, which was being constructed twenty feet from its northern property line. During the winter months, from two in the afternoon until the end of the day, the shadow of Defendant’s addition will extend over the cabana, swimming pool, and sunbathing areas of Eden Roc, which is located on the southern portion of Plaintiff’s property. Plaintiff filed suit when the addition was eight stories high. Plaintiff contended that the shadow, which would be cast by the addition would render Plaintiff’s beach wholly unfit for the use and enjoyment of its guests. Plaintiff also contends that Defendant’s intention to build the addition on the north side of their property was motivated in part by malice and ill will. Construction on the south side of Defendant’s property would not have caused the same problems. Plaintiff alleged that the construction would interfere with the easements of light and air enjoyed by Pla

Issue
Does Plaintiff have a legal right to the flow of light and air across the adjoining land of a neighbor?

Held
No. Judgment reversed.

Discussion
This type of situation is one best left to the legislature. There is no common law easement for light or air, but the legislature has imposed height restrictions. Height restrictions raise takings and just compensation issues.
