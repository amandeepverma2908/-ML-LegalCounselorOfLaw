311 Mass. 677, 42 N.E.2d 808 (1942)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff brought suit after he bought a house from Defendant, which was later found to be infested by termites.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
This case fails to extend tort liability for nondisclosure in a contract situation.

Facts
Plaintiff bought a house from Defendant, which he intended to occupy with his family. After learning the house was infested by termites, Plaintiff brought suit based on nondisclosure, claiming that Defendant breached its duty to Plaintiff when it knowingly failed to disclose the condition of the property. Plaintiff sought damages in tort, based on a duty-breach negligence standard. The lower court demurred Plaintiffâ€™s declaration, and Plaintiff appealed.

Issue
This case considers whether nondisclosure in a contractual situation can also lead to tort damages.

Held
Affirmed.

Discussion
While a seller is contractually obligated to disclose non-apparent defects, he may not be held liable, in tort, for nondisclosure, without a showing of malice.
