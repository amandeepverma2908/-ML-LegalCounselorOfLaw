Brief Fact Summary
Paramount Pictures Corp. (Defendant) produced a movie, which, according to Robert Muzikowski (Plaintiff), portrayed him in an unflattering and false manner. Plaintiff sued Defendant for defamation.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
If a statement is capable of two reasonable constructions, one defamatory and one innocent, the innocent one will prevail.

Facts

A book, Hardball: A Season in the Projects was published, which devoted some attention to Plaintiff and his life.

No character in the movie is named Robert or Muzikowski and there are no references to Little League Baseball. The credits of Hardball state, “[w]hile this motion picture is in part inspired by actual events, persons and organizations, this is a fictitious story and no actual persons, events or organizations have been portrayed.” The O’Neill character in the movie version of Hardball experiences was almost identical to Plaintiff. The only differences, in Plaintiff’s opinion, are unflattering and false as applied to the real man. When Defendant announce

Issue
If a statement is capable of two reasonable constructions, one defamatory and one innocent, will the innocent one will prevail?

Held
Yes. Judgment reversed.

Discussion
In this case, the district court erred in granting Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment. Plaintiff should be allowed to present evidence to a jury that no person could reasonably have thought that O’Neil was portrayed as someone other than Plaintiff.
