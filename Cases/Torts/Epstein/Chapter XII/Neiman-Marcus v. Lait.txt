17 F.R.D. 119, 1954 U.S. Dist.

Brief Fact Summary
The Defendants, Lait and others (Defendants), wrote an article making accusations about three groups of employees at the Plaintiff, Neiman-Marcusâ€™s (Plaintiff), department store. Plaintiff and representatives of each of these groups brought a libel suit.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A large group of individuals cannot bring a libel claim unless the allegedly libelous statement makes specific defamatory statements against an individual member of the group.

Facts
The Defendants were the authors of a book entitled U.S.A. Confidential. The book made claims against Plaintiff who operated a department store in Texas. Plaintiff alleges that the article libeled and defamed three groups of its employees. Plaintiff sued in the following groups: (1) Nine individual models that constitute the entire group of models; (2) Fifteen salesmen suing on behalf of twenty-five salesman; and (3) Thirty saleswomen suing on behalf of 382 saleswomen.

Issue
Can a designated group of individuals sue for libel when less than all of the designated group are libeled?

Held
No. Complaint dismissed with leave to file separate complaints.

Discussion
If a single member of a large group presents particular circumstances that point to that member as the person defamed, that individual may have a cause of action.
