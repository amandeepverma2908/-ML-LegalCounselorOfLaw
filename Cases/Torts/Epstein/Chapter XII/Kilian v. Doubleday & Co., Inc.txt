Brief Fact Summary
An article written in the first person described acts of cruelty committed by the Plaintiff, Killian (Plaintiff) an army Colonel. The events were actually witnessed by other individuals and relayed to the author. Plaintiff brought a libel action, and the Defendant, Doubleday & Co., Inc. (Defendant), answered claiming truth.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Specific charges cannot be defended through a claim of truth by a showing of Plaintiff’s general bad character.

Facts
A book was created from the writings of disabled veterans taking an English course. One of the veterans, O’Connell, wrote a story in the first person that was actually based on stories that were described to him by other soldiers who allegedly witnessed them. The story described acts of cruelty and unauthorized punishments administered by Plaintiff. At the end of the story, Dr. Wolfe, the professor of the course, added a footnote claiming that Plaintiff was convicted of permitting cruel and unusual punishment and received a reprimand and a small fine for his crime. Plaintiff brought suit for libel and Defendant answered by claiming truth as a defense.

Issue
Did the trial court err by submitting to the jury the question of whether the publication was substantially true?

Held
Yes. Judgment reversed and a new trial awarded.

Discussion
Truth is an absolute defense to charges of defamation.
