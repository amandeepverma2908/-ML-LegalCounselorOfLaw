Citation
69 N.D. 610, 289 N.W. 101,1939 N.D.

Brief Fact Summary
Ellsworth (Plaintiff) alleged that Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory, Inc. (Defendant) misstated Plaintiff’s professional and financial rating in its directory. Plaintiff sued Defendant for libel.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In an action for defamation, Plaintiff may be able to prove special damages by prove of reduced business revenue.

Facts
Plaintiff alleged that Defendant misstated Plaintiff’s professional and financial rating in its directory. The directory is widely read by lawyers who forward legal business. Plaintiff claimed that this was defamatory and his reputation was injured. Plaintiff entered into evidence, Defendant’s listings for the years 1928 and 1929. In 1928 Defendant downgraded Plaintiff. In 1929, Defendant left his rating blank. Plaintiff also introduced evidence that his earnings were substantially lower in 1928. When the case was first before the court, it was held that the alleged defamation was not actionable per se and that Plaintiff would have to prove special damages. Plaintiff amended his complaint and alleged that his earnings were substantially lower and that he was damaged by more than $2,500.00. This was an appeal from an order overruling a demurrer to the amended complaint.

Issue
Does the mere allegation of reduced business revenue suffice for a pleading of special damages in a defamation action?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
In this case, the claim of a general loss of business sufficed for special damages under a claim of libel.
