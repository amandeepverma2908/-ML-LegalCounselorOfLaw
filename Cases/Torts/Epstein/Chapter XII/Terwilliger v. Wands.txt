Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff, Wands (Plaintiff), brought a slander action against the Defendant, Terwilliger (Defendant), claiming the Defendant made statements accusing the Plaintiff of having intercourse with a married woman and trying to keep this woman’s husband in jail.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Special damages must be claimed in a slander suit that is not slander per se. Only pecuniary injuries affecting one’s character will suffice.

Facts
The Plaintiff proved at trial that the Defendant suggested that the Plaintiff was going to a Mrs. Fuller’s house to have intercourse, that this woman was a bad woman, and that the Plaintiff was doing everything in his power to keep Mrs. Fuller’s husband in the penitentiary so that he could have free access to Mrs. Fuller. The Plaintiff brought an action for slander. A motion for nonsuit was sustained by the trial court.

Issue
Did the Plaintiff prove special damages, as is required when a slander cause of action is not slander per se?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
Four types of slander are actionable without proof of special damages under the common law. These are imputations (i) of a major crime; (ii) of a loathsome disease; (iii) affecting one’s business trade, profession, or office; (iv) of serious sexual misconduct.
