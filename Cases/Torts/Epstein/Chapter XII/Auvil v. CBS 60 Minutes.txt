517 U.S. 1167 116 S. Ct. 1567 134 L. Ed. 2d 666 1996 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
In a segment, CBS 60 Minutes (Defendant) told the public that a chemical sprayed on Plaintiff’s apples was dangerous. Plaintiffs sued Defendant for product disparagement.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
For a product disparagement claim to be actionable, Plaintiff must prove, inter alia, the falsity of the disparaging statements.

Facts
Defendant aired a segment on daminozide, a chemical growth regulator sprayed on apples. The broadcast was largely based on a Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) report. Scientific research had indicated that daminozide breaks down into a carcinogen. Following Defendant’s broadcast, consumer demand for apples decreased dramatically. The apple growers and others dependent upon apple production lost millions of dollars and many growers lost their homes and livelihoods. In 1990, eleven growers (Plaintiffs) sued Defendant, the NRDC and a public relations firm used by NRDC for product disparagement. The district court held that Plaintiffs failed to prove the falsity of the message conveyed by Defendant’s broadcast. Plaintiffs appealed.

Issue
In order to prove product disparagement, must Plaintiffs show that the statements were false?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
In this case, summary judgment was properly granted to Defendants because Plaintiffs failed to introduce any evidence that the statements themselves were false.
