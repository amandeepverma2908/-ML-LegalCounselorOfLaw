393 U.S. 825 89 S. Ct. 88 21 L. Ed. 2d 96 1968 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant, Orlando Daily Newspapers, Inc. (Defendant), published an article claiming that the Plaintiff, Belli (Plaintiff), an attorney, took advantage of an agreement with the Florida Bar Association (the Association), charging a large clothing bill to the Association. The article was false, and Plaintiff brought a defamation suit.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
If the meaning of an article is capable of two interpretations, one being defamatory and the other not, it is for the jury to determine the meaning of the article based on all of the evidence.

Facts
The Plaintiff was a nationally prominent attorney. Another attorney, Mr. Handley, had a conversation with a columnist for the Defendant in which he related a story he had heard regarding Plaintiff. The story was that Plaintiff and his wife ran up a large clothing bill at a Florida hotel, at the expense of the Association. The columnist published the story with embellishments and the story turned out to be false. The Plaintiff brought an action for libel and slander. The District Court dismissed Plaintiffâ€™s complaint for failure to state a claim.

Issue
Was the District Court correct that the determination of whether a statement is a libel or slander per se is solely for the court?

Held
No. Judgment reversed and remanded.

Discussion
The Court in this case felt that the facts strongly suggested the article was defamatory, but refused to exercise the role of the jury due to First Amendment constitutional considerations.
