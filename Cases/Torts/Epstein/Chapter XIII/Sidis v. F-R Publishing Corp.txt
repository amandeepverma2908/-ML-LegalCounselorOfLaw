Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant, F-R Publishing Corp. (Defendant), wrote an article about the Plaintiff, William James Sidis (Plaintiff) who was once a public figure. The article was of public interest, however, it intruded upon the Plaintiff’s private life. The Plaintiff sued the Defendant for intrusion on his right to privacy.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Certain public figures must sacrifice their privacy and expose at least part of their lives to public scrutiny as the price of the power they attain.
