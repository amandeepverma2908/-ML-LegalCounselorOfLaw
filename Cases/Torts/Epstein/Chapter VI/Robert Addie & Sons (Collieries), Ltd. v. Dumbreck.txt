Brief Fact Summary
Dumbreck’s son entered Robert Addie & Sons Ltd.’s (Defendant’s) land, and was killed by Defendant’s haulage system.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The trespasser comes onto Defendant’s premises at his own risk. Defendant is liable only when the injury is due to some willful act involving something more than the absence of reasonable care.

Facts
Defendant operated a haulage system in its fields. This system consisted of two parts: the engine, which operated the system, and a wheel about which a cable turned. The wheel was not visible from the engine. This wheel was dangerous, but very attractive to children. Defendant took some measures to keep children away from the wheel; however, the measures were only in the form of brief admonishments and warnings. It was evident that Defendant was more concerned about the safety of its own property then of the safety of the trespassers. The surrounding hedge had several gaps, making it easy for children to pass over the property. Children, in fact, often used the property as a shortcut. The two gates had signs warning trespassers that they would be prosecuted. Dumbreck’s (Plaintiff’s) son was a four-year old boy. He had been warned by Plaintiff not to go into the field. However, he ignored the warning, entered the property, was caught in the wheel mechanism, and died. The court

Issue
Does Defendant, a landowner, owe a special duty of care to a Plaintiff’s child, a trespasser?

Held
No. Judgment reversed.

Discussion
This case shows the harsh result when the party injured on the land of another is classified as a trespasser.
