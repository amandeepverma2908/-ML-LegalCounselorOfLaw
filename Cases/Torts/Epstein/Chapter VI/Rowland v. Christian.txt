Synopsis of Rule of Law
Ordinary principles of negligence may be used to determine the liability of a landowner to a person coming onto the property.

Facts
Plaintiff was a social guest in Defendantâ€™s apartment. Plaintiff asked to use the bathroom and was injured when a cracked handle of the cold-water faucet on the basin broke and severed tendons and nerves on his right hand. Defendant had known for two weeks that the handle was cracked, and had complained to the manager. However, she did not warn Plaintiff. A summary judgment was given to Defendant. Plaintiff appealed.

Issue
May ordinary principles of negligence be used to determine the liability of a landowner to a person coming onto the property?

Held
Yes. Judgment reversed.

Dissent
(Justice Burke) The distinctions between trespassers, licensees, and invitees have been applied for many years. These classifications have a stability and predictability in their outcome. If these issues must be decided on a case-by-case basis under the laws of negligence, they will be bereft of the guiding principles and precedent the law has provided. It is not the proper function of a court to overturn the learning, wisdom, and experience of the past in this field; that is the domain of the Legislature.

Discussion
This court applies common law negligence on the owners and occupiers of land notwithstanding the traditional distinctions in the law.
