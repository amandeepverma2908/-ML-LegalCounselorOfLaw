Brief Fact Summary
Collins (Defendant) unintentionally and without fault entered and damaged Brown (Plaintiff) land when his horses became frightened. Plaintiff sued Defendant for trespass.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The distinction made between natural and unnatural use of land is not established in the law. The rule in Rylands v. Fletcher would impose penalty upon efforts made in a reasonable, skillful, and careful manner.

Facts
Defendant was waiting by a railroad crossing on his wagon, which was loaded with grain and drawn by two horses. An engine on the railroad frightened the horses and Defendant’s horses became unmanageable. The horses ran and struck a stone post with a street lamp owned by Plaintiff. The Defendant used ordinary care and skill in managing the horses. Plaintiff sued Defendant for trespass.

Issue
Is Defendant liable to Plaintiff for the unintentional damage done to Plaintiff’s land?

Held
No. Judgment for Defendant.

Discussion
In this case the court abandons the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher. The court found that the effect of the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher was to impose a penalty upon a person’s effort, which was made in a reasonable, skillful, and careful manner. This case holds that a person is only liable for damage to neighboring property, which is caused by his negligence. For example, a person who has a fire on his land, which escapes to his neighbors’ land, is not liable unless his negligence caused the damage.
