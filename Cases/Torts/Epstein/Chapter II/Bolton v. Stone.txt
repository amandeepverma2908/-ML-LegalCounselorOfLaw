108 Fed. Appx. 548, 2004 U.S. App

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff was struck in the head by a cricket ball from Defendant’s cricket club. Plaintiff sued Defendant for public nuisance and negligence.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The test to be applied here is whether the risk of damage to a person on the road was so small that a reasonable man in the position of the Defendant, considering the matter from the point of view of safety, would have thought it right to refrain from taking steps to prevent danger.

Facts
Plaintiff lived on a side street next to a cricket ground. She was at the gate in front of the house when she was struck on the head by a cricket ball. The ball that hit Plaintiff was one of the longest balls that had ever been hit at the grounds during the last forty years. The cricket ground was large enough for all practical purposes. The field was surrounded by a twelve-foot high fence. Witnesses testified that over a thirty-year period about six to ten balls had been hit onto Plaintiff’s Side Street. Plaintiff sued the home cricket club and all of its members. She alleged that the cricket grounds constituted a public nuisance. She separately alleged common law negligence. The trial court gave judgment to the Defendant on both the public nuisance and negligence counts. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment on the negligence claim. Defendant then appealed to the House of Lords.

Issue
Must Defendant not carry out or permit an operation that he knows or ought to know clearly can cause such damage, however improbable that result may be?

Held
No. Judgment reversed.

Discussion
In its ruling in favor of Defendant, the court uses a negligence theory. In the application of its negligence theory, the court held that Defendant took reasonable care to prevent the accident to Plaintiff. Although the accident to Plaintiff is unfortunate, Defendant is not liable.
