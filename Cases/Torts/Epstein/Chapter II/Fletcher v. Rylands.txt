159 ER 737, Volume 159<br />

Brief Fact Summary
Water from Defendant’s reservoir escaped onto Plaintiff’s land because of an unknown latent defect in Defendant’s subsoil. Plaintiff sued Defendant for trespass.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
This action is maintainable on the plain ground that Defendant has caused water to flow into Plaintiff’s land.

Facts
Flooding waters from a reservoir constructed on Defendant’s land damaged Plaintiff’s property. The water from the reservoir would not have escaped from Defendant’s land and no mischief would have been done to Plaintiff, but for a latent defect in Defendant’s subsoil. Plaintiff sued Defendant for trespass. Opinions are taken from the intermediate appellate court.

Issue
Is Defendant liable to Plaintiff in trespass for damage caused as a result of a defect in Defendant’s land if he was not aware of the defect?

Held
Yes. (B. Bramwell) Judgment for Plaintiff.

Dissent
(B. Martin) Judgment should be in favor of Defendant.

Discussion
In this case the court holds Defendant liable for the trespass on the theory of strict liability. Both opinions state that Defendant is not liable on a theory of trespass, nuisance, or negligence.Fletcher v. Rylands

Synopsis of Rule of Law

Plaintiff sued Defendant for trespass.

Issue
