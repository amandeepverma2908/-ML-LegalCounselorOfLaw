Facts
Two dogs, belonging to Plaintiff and Defendant, were fighting. Defendant took a stick about four feet long and commenced beating the dogs in order to separate them. Plaintiff was looking on. In their struggle, the dogs approached the place where Plaintiff was standing. Defendant retreated backwards from the dogs, striking them as he retreated.

Plaintiff sued Defendant in an action of trespass for assault and battery.

Issue
Is Defendant responsible for damage done by an unintentional act?

Held
No. Judgment for Defendant. New trial ordered.

Discussion
If the injury was unavoidable, and the conduct of Defendant was free from blame, then Defendant will not be liable. Plaintiff bears the burden of showing that either the intention was unlawful or that Defendant was at fault. This case also discusses the concept of contributory negligence. If the court finds that Plaintiff was contributorily negligent in causing his injury, he cannot recover. In other words, if Plaintiffâ€™s own negligence contributed to his injury, he cannot recover under a negligence theory.
