Held
The trial court’s decision was reversed and the verdict reinstated.

Discussion
The Court distills battery as a tort concerned primarily with personal dignity, not merely personal space. However, the Court repeatedly refers to offenses to “the person”, implying that some nexus with physical contact must be present in cases of battery. The Court suggests that any objects grasped by a person are considered part of “the person” for the purposes of battery. Other courts have sometimes referred to such objects as “appurtenances”.
