Brief Fact Summary
Petitioner alleged damages resulting from a federal agent acting unlawfully.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Actions for damages may be brought against federal agents acting unlawfully as they carry out their duties of the United States.

However, when there is a general right to sue under a federal statut
