Brief Fact Summary
A union representative intentionally induced a breach of contract entered into between a chorus group manger and various theatres.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Intentional interference with a contractual agreement may, depending on the circumstance, be legally justified.

Facts
A manager of a chorus group underpaid members of the chorus group for their various performances. A representative from the Actors’ Association, a performance union, persuaded owners of theatres to cancel contracts held with the manager of the chorus group until higher wagers were paid to the chorus group members.

Discussion
This case is quite interesting because the Chancery Division makes a ruling not by using any concrete rule set out by law or in other cases, but, the court, seems to go with a moral or gut feel as to how to decide this case. The court is doubtful that the manager of the chorus group would receive any “sympathy or support [from] decent men and women.”
