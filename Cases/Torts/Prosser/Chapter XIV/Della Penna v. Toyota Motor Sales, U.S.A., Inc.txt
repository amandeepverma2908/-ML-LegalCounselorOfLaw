Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff, Della Penna (Plaintiff), is a distributor of automobiles. The Defendant, Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (Defendant), made a policy disallowing the sale and distribution of the line of cars outside the United States. The Defendant published a list of “offenders”, parties supposedly guilty of this practice and told its franchise owners not to do business with them, threatening punishment if they did.
