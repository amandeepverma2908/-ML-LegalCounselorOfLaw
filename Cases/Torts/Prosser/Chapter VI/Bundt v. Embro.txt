27 A.D.2d 931 278 N.Y.S.2d 770, 1967 N.Y. App. Div.

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiffs, five passengers injured in a two car accident (Plaintiffs), brought a negligence action against Defendants for an automobile accident. The Defendants were the drivers of the two cars and a contractor repairing the highway obstructing a stop sign (Defendants). Defendants moved to amend their answers to add the defense of discharge and satisfaction because Plaintiffs recovered a judgment against the state for the same injuries.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The defense of discharge and satisfaction provides that multiple judgments cannot be satisfied against multiple defendants for the same tort.

Facts
This case involves an action by five plaintiffs, who were passengers in one of two automobiles that collided. Actions were brought against the drivers, as well as a contractor repairing the highway who negligently obstructed a stop sign. Defendants moved to amend their answers to add the defense of discharge and satisfaction because Plaintiffs recovered a judgment for the same injuries against the State of New York.

Issue
Is the defense of discharge and satisfaction applicable to prevent multiple judgments from being satisfied against different tortfeasors when one judgment has already been satisfied?

Held
Yes. Leave to amend granted to Defendants.

Discussion
The defense of discharge and satisfaction prevents double recovery from a single injury. While states are immune as sovereign at common law, states are free to waive this immunity and grant courts jurisdiction to determine claims against it.
