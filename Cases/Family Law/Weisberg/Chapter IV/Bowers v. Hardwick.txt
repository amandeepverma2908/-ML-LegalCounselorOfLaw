478 U.S. 186, 106 S. Ct. 2841, 92 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1986)

Brief Fact Summary
Respondent was charged for committing sodomy after he engaged in the act with another adult male in respondent’s home.  Respondent claimed that his status as a homosexual placed him in imminent danger of arrest.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The right to engage in sodomy in the privacy of the home is not a fundamental right protected by the United States Constitution.

Facts
Respondent Hardwick was charged with violating a Georgia statute criminalizing sodomy when he committed that act with another adult male in respondent’s home bedroom.  The District Attorney decided not to present the matter to a grand jury, and respondent brought suit claiming that the statute was unconstitutional in criminalizing consensual sodomy.  Respondent claimed standing by asserting that he was a practicing homosexual, and that the statute placed him in imminent danger of arrest.

Issue
Does the United States Constitution provide for a fundamental right for homosexuals to engage in sodomy?

Held
The conduct in question is not a fundamental right protected by the Constitution.

Dissent
The Fourth Amendment provides protections for one’s home.  The right of adults to conduct intimate relationships in the privacy of the home falls under this protection.

Discussion
The Court in this case found that sodomy falls outside of the penumbra of Constitutional rights qualifying for heightened judicial protection.
