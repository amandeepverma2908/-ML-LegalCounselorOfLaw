Brief Fact Summary
Two male adults lived together as life-partners for years.  One of the men passed away, and the other brought suit against the estate claiming an entitlement to the community property under the theory that they were involved in a meretricious relationship.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Court found that the relationship was not meretricious or quasi marital because the parties were unable to legally marry.

Facts
Frank Vasquez and Robert Schwerzler lived together for almost thirty years.  When Schwerzler died, he had assets including the house he and Vasquez shared, a life insurance policy, two automobiles, and a checking account.  No will was found.  Vasquez filed a claim against the estate claiming he and Schwerzler had been homosexual life-partners and that he was entitled under case law for division of property in meretricious relationships to a share of the community property.  Hawthorne, the appointed personal representative for the estate, denied his claim.  Vasquez appealed to the superior court and it ruled in his favor, awarding nearly all of the property to him on partial summary judgment.  Hawthorn appealed.

Issue
Did the trial court err by treating Vasquezâ€™s relationship with Schwerzler as a meretricious relationship because as a matter of law, same-sex relationships cannot be meretricious relationships?

Held
The trial court erred.  A same-sex relationship cannot be a meretricious relationship because such persons do not have a quasi-marital relationship.

Discussion
Based upon precedent the Court found that because a same-sex relationship could not result in a legal marriage, is was not a quasi-marital relationship.  However, the claimant could have other potential legal rights to recover property from his former partner.
