Brief Fact Summary
Appellant petitioned to be appointed guardian of her lesbian partner after her partner was involved in a serious accident.  The court denied appellant’s petition and instead attempted to appoint what it considered to be a neutral guardian.

Synopsis of Rule of Law

The trial court appointed Tomberlin in an effort to reconcile arguments from Sharon’s family; however the standard for appointment is the best interests for the ward, not the family.
