Brief Fact Summary
M. brought suit after dissolution of her same-sex relationship with H. for partition of property and support.  She also challenged a Canadian Act that provided for marital support in some instances for opposite-sex nonmarrital couples but did not provide the same support for same-sex couples.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Act violated the Canadian Charter because it violated Canada’s equivalent to the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.

Facts
M. and H. were women living together in a same-sex relationship that continued for at least 5 years.  They occupied a home that H. owned and paid the upkeep for, but the parties agreed to share living expenses and household responsibilities equally.  In 1982, M. and H. started their own advertising business, which enjoyed immediate success.  H.’s contribution to the company was greater than M.’s, because M. had no previous experience in advertising and eventually devoted more of her time to domestic tasks.  The parties continued to be equal shareholders in the company.  The two bought properties together, eventually resulting in the construction of a country home.  A downturn in the advertising business created increased debt, and H. took an outside job and placed a mortgage on her home.  M. unsuccessfully tried to find employment.

Issue
Does the extension of the right to seek spousal support to members of unmarried opposite-sex couples infringe on Section:15(1) of the Charter (Canada’s equivalent to the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution) by failing to provide the same rights to members of same-sex couples?

Held
Because the exclusion of such people perpetuates the disadvantages suffered by individuals in same-sex relationships and contributes to the erasure of their existence, the challenged section of the Act violates the Charter.

Discussion
This case is useful in comparing Canada’s analysis of constitutional equal protection challenges to such analysis under American law.
