Brief Fact Summary
Testimony revealed that appellant, a married man, had spent significant amounts of time away from his home with co-respondent, a woman in a separate marital relationship.  Appellant’s wife was granted a divorce based on appellant’s adultery.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
To prove adultery through circumstantial evidence, it must be established that there was both an opportunity and a disposition to commit the act.

Appellant, William Lickle, was married in 1917 to respondent, Margaret Lickle.  The parties had not cohabited for many years, although they resided in the same house.  In 1937 appellant met Gordon Boone and his wife Edith, the co-respondent.  While Gordon Boone was commissioned overseas in the navy, Appellant and Edith became increasingly intimate.  Appellant was a frequent visitor to each of Edith’s four homes, and one of her maids testified that appellant was at one of the homes most of the time.  Another maid testified that he stayed overnight several times a week at two of Edith’s later homes.  Twice during the summer of 1943 appellant and Edith vacationed in Maryland.

Based on the facts the Court found that sufficient circumstantial evidence was present to find that adultery had occurred.
