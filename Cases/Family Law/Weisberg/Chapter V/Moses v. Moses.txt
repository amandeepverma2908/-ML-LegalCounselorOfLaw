Brief Fact Summary
Appellee engaged in extensive personal and telephonic conversations with her divorce attorney regarding matters other than the representation.  Appellant challenged the court’s granting of attorney’s fees and expenses to his wife’s counsel.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
There is an obligation upon counsel, if he expects his fee to be paid by the other spouse, to control excessive demands upon his time, energy and intellect by the dependent spouse.

Facts
During a divorce proceeding appellee, Mrs. Moses, consumed many billable hours with her attorney, Mr. Fox, in personal and telephonic conversations.  Indications suggested that large parts of the discussions were based upon Mr. Fox’s friendship with both Dr. Moses (appellant) and appellee, as well as his professional relationship with appellee.  The calls occurred at all hours of the day and night and resulted in the attorney’s withdrawal from the case.  The attorney averaged two hours a day, including weekends and holidays, working on appellee’s problems, with the only tangible result being a support order for appellee and the children of $275 weekly.  No divorce occurred.  Appellant appealed the courts award of attorney’s fees and expenses to his wife’s counsel.

Issue
Did the court err by rewarding excessive fees to be paid by appellant to appellee’s attorney?

Held
There is an obligation upon counsel, if he expects his fee to be paid by the other spouse, to control excessive demands upon his time, energy and intellect by the dependent spouse.  In the present case the attorney failed to exercise such control.

Discussion
The Court lessened the attorney fees because the time and labor required, the results obtained, and the nature and length of the attorney’s professional relationship with appellee mitigated against the high fee.
