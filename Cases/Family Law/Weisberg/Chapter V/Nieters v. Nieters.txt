Facts
Husband filed a petition for dissolution of marriage in 1989, his wife filed an answer denying that the marriage was irretrievably broken.  The husband testified that the couple had been separated since September, 1988, and that he had a current relationship with a woman named Cindy Yates.  The wife stated that the differences regarded how the children should be raised and that she had donated some money she earned to televangelists.  The trial court dissolved the marriage, divided the marital property and awarded primary custody f the children to the wife, and awarded her child support and attorneyâ€™s fees.  She filed a motion to amend judgment or in the alternative to order a new trial alleging that husband had not provided sufficient evidence to sustain a finding that the marriage was irretrievably broken.  The trial court denied the motion
