However, reasons for leaving the marriage other than an intent to desert may justify discontinuance of the relationship without giving rise to grounds for divorce.

Facts
Judith Reid married Dr. Robert Reid in 1965.  Mrs. Reid worked in medical technology in a local hospital and Dr. Reid was in medical school.  In 1966 the first of four children were born to the couple.  In 1967 the couple moved to New York City where Dr. Reid completed internship and residency.  Following a stint by Dr. Reid in the Navy, the couple moved to Charlottesville, where Dr. Reid obtained a position at the University.  He became tenured, head of his division, and director of the nurse practitioner program.  He subsequently left the University to establish a medical corporation.

Did the circumstances both parties attest to provide justification as a matter of law for Mrs. Reid leaving the marriage?

Discussion
The Court sympathizes with Mrs. Reid’s marital problems, but a concise application of the law forces a determination that Mrs. Reid deserted the marriage and had no reason to do so other than the intent to desert.  Thus, she is at fault and barred from collecting spousal support.
