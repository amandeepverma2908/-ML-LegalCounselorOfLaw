155 So. 2d 669; 1963 Fla. App.

Brief Fact Summary
Appellant’s daughter claimed that he committed acts of sexual assault on her.  A State’s expert testified that her case was consistent with Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome, and appellant challenged the testimony.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Court held that the CSAAS testimony is admissible for the sole purpose of explaining a victim’s specific behavior which might be incorrectly construed as inconsistent with an abuse victim or to rebut an attack on the victim’s credibility.

Facts
Appellant fathered children with 4 separate women, with he and his second wife producing D-2 (the prosecutrix).  D-2 claimed that appellant committed 7 different acts of first degree sexual assault on his daughter.  Appellant challenges the admission of expert testimony from the State’s expert concerning the Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome (CSAAS).  Appellant’s objections are based on a Wyoming rule of evidence that permits admission of expert testimony only if it will assist the trier of fact.  Appellant argues the testimony violated the evidentiary rules because it is not generally recognized in the field of psychology and thus is not sufficiently reliable to assist the jury.  The expert was qualified as an expert in child psychology and child sexual psychopathology.

Issue
Is the CSAAS testimony generally recognized in the field of psychology so as to be sufficiently reliable to assist the jury?

Held
CSAA evidence is admissible with certain limitations.

Discussion
The case presents an overview of the admissibility of expert scientific testimony, with the Court ultimately determining that they would admit the testimony in limited circumstances consistent with other jurisdictions.
