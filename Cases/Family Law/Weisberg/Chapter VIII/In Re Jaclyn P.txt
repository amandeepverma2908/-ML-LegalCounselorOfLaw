Brief Fact Summary
Respondent was accused of sexually abusing his children, and evidence was adduced from various sources to support this allegation at trial.  The trial court held that respondent’s evidence refuted this evidence and thus a case against respondent was not made by a preponderance of the evidence.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The testimony of various experts, including psychiatrists and pediatricians, is used as evidence to support civil allegations of sexual abuse.

Facts
Respondent Robert P., the father of Melissa P. and Jaclyn P., had proceedings commenced against him alleging that he had sexually abused and neglected both daughters.  Melissa’s mother testified that she first learned of the abuse when her niece and her daughter Jaclyn both reported that Melissa had hurt them by placing her fingers inside their vaginas.  Melissa reported she had been playing the doctor game taught to her by her father, and that her father had also taught her the weenie game, in which he placed his penis in her mouth.  She also stated that Melissa had been exhibiting behavioral problems and suffered from nightmares.  Melissa’s mother contacted Child Protective Services (CPS) who sent a caseworker to meet with Melissa twice monthly for 25 visits.  On one visit, Melissa described the doctor game and demonstrated by poking her fingers between the legs of a stuffed animal.  She reportedly told the caseworker that her father touched her in the same manner.  Melissa
