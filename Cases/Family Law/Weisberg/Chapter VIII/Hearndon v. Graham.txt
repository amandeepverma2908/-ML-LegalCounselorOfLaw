767 So. 2d 1179,2000 Fla.25 Fla. L. Weekly S 682

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff brought a complaint alleging that she was the victim of sexual abuse that caused her to suffer from traumatic amnesia.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The delayed discovery doctrine generally provides that a cause of action does not accrue until the plaintiff either knows or reasonably should know of the tortious act giving rise to the cause of action.

Facts
Paula Hearndon, plaintiff, filed a complaint in 1991 against Kenneth Graham for injuries that resulted from sexual abuses he allegedly committed beginning in 1968 and continuing until 1975.  The complaint was dismissed without prejudice on the grounds that the action was barred by the four-year statute of limitations.  Plaintiff argued that the court should apply the doctrine of delayed discovery of an injury to toll the statute of limitations because she suffered from traumatic amnesia.  The trial court dismissed the complaint, and the district court affirmed, reasoning that the Legislature provided explicit tolling provisions that did not include delayed discovery due to lack of memory.

Issue
Should the delayed discovery doctrine by applied to cases of traumatic amnesia caused by childhood sexual abuse?

Held
The delayed discovery doctrine is applicable to accrue the statute of limitations.

Discussion
This Court finds that the doctrine of delayed discovery is applicable in cases of traumatic amnesia caused by abuse to accrue the statute of limitations.
