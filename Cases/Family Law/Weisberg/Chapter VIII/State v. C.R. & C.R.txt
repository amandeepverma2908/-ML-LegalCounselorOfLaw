Brief Fact Summary
Parents argued that they did not owe the State support for time their child spent in it’s custody because he had been emancipated under the common law.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Judicial emancipation refers to the nonstatutory termination of certain rights and obligations of the parent-child relationship during the child’s minority.

Facts
In 1984 R.R., nearly 15, left his parents’ home and left with various relatives.  In 1985, a petition was filed alleging that R.R. was a dependant child.  The court found R.R. to be dependent within the meaning of the statute and temporarily awarded legal custody of R.R. to the Utah Department of Family Services (DFS).  In 1986 the temporary order terminated and custody was awarded to R.R.’s parents, to be supervised by DFS.  The State filed a petition against R.R.’s parents seeking reimbursement in support for R.R. expended during the period he was in DFS’s custody.

Discussion
Although the issue of this case is emancipation, the case provides a good analysis of the duties and obligations of the parent-child relationship.
