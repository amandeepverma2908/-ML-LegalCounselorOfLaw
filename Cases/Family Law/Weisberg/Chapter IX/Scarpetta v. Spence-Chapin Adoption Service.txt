Brief Fact Summary
Mother attempted to regain custody of her child after surrendering her child to adoptive services.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A mother should be allowed to regain custody of her child provided there is some showing of improvidence in the making of the surrender, that the interest of such child will be promoted and that such parent is fit, competent, and able to duly maintain, support and educate such child.

Facts
An infant child was born to Olga Scarpetta on May 18, 1970.  Four days after birth, she placed the infant for boarding care with Spence-Chapin Adoption Service.  On June 18, the baby was placed with a family for adoption.  Five days later, the mother repented her actions and requested the return of the child.  The mother commenced a habeas corpus proceeding.  Before surrender of the child, the mother had several interviews with representatives of the adoption agency, However, shortly before or after the birth of the child, her well-to-do family in Columbia assured her of their support and urged her to raise her own child.

Issue
May a mother who has surrendered her child to an authorized adoption agency regain the child’s custody?

Held
The surrender of the child was improvident and the child’s best interests would be best served by its return to the natural mother.

Discussion
The Court finds that surrender of a child to an adoption agency does not constitute abandonment, and the child should be returned to the natural mother so long as there is some showing of improvidence in the making of the surrender, that the interest of such child will be promoted and that such parent is fit, competent, and able to duly maintain, support and educate such child.
