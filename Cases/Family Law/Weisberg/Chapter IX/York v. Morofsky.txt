225 Mich. App. 333,571 N.W.2d 524,1997 Mich. App.

Brief Fact Summary
During a divorce proceeding plaintiff disclaimed defendant’s parentage of a child, even though he had always acted as the child’s father.  The court determined that he was neither the child’s biological or equitable parent and denied requests for stepparent visitation.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Equitable parenthood is a permanent status.  If a party satisfies the criteria for equitable parenthood for a reasonable period of time, a subsequent change would not alter the party’s status.

Facts
During a divorce proceeding plaintiff disclaimed defendant’s parentage of a child born during their marriage.  Before this, defendant had always acted as, and believed himself to be, the father.  No paternity testing has been performed, and the trial court entered the divorce judgment excluding the child as a child of the marriage.  The court later determined that defendant was not the child’s biological or equitable parent and denied defendant’s requests for stepparent visitation.

Issue
Did the trial court err in finding that defendant was not an equitable parent to the child?

Held
The trial court erred by failing to consider facts that led to the conclusion that defendant had attained the status of an equitable parent.

Discussion
This case demonstrates the criteria for establishing the status of an equitable parent and demonstrates that once obtained, such status is permanent.
