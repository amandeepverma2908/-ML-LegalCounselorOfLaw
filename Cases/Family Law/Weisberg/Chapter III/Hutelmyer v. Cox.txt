Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff brought suit against Defendant for alienating the affections of her husband and criminal conversation after Defendant actively participated in an extramarital affair with Plaintiff’s husband.  Punitive and compensatory damages were awarded at trial for Plaintiff.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Alienation of affections and criminal conversation may be established when defendant’s wrongful actions are the effective cause of alienation between spouses.

Facts
Plaintiff was happily married to Mr. Hutelmyer with three children.  Mr. Hutelmyer’s secretary, Defendant Cox, divorced  and she and Mr. Hutelmyer began to have an extramarital affair.

This resulted in strained relationships at Mr. Hutelmyer’s home and an eventual end to all sexual relationships with his wife.  Plaintiff and her husband separated, and Plaintiff brought an action against Defendant for alienating the affections of her husband and for criminal conversation.  At trial Plaintiff was awarded both punitive and compensatory damages.

Held
