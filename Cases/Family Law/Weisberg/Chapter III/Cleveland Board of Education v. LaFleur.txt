Brief Fact Summary
Teachers brought suit under two state laws placing fixed cutoff dates for mandatory maternity leave and establishing set requirements prior to return.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires such rules must not needlessly, arbitrarily, or capriciously impinge upon the vital area of a teacher’s constitutional liberty.

Facts
A Cleveland Board of Education rule required pregnant school teachers to take maternity leave without pay five months before the expected birth.  The teacher is not promised re-employment after birth, but is given priority in reassignment to a qualified position.  Failure to comply with the rule is ground for dismissal.  Jo Carol LaFleur and Ann Elizabeth Nelson were forced against their wishes to take the mandatory maternity leave.

Issue
Do the interests advanced in support of the School Boards Rules justify the particular procedures adopted? Do the particular means chosen to achieve the School Boards’ objectives unduly infringe upon the teachers’ constitutional liberty?

Held
The School Boards’ rules requiring maternity leave at a specific date for all pregnant individuals is overly broad and violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  The Cleveland return rule is arbitrary and irrational, and therefore serves no legitimate state interest.  The Chesterfield return rule serves a legitimate state purpose and is constitutional.

Discussion
The Court analyzed the two rules under the rational relationship test to determine Constitutionality under the Due Process Clause.  Requirements that medical leave be obtained prior to returning to work and that the teacher return at the beginning of a semester where deemed rational, while the fixed cutoff dates for maternity leave were not.
