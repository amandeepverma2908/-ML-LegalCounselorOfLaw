562 F.2d 561,1977 U.S. App.

Brief Fact Summary
Mrs. Myra Bradwell brought suit challenging Illinois denial of her right to practice law under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Separate spheres ideology allowed Illinois to prohibit women from practicing law.  Women’s admission to the bar is not protected by the Fourteenth Amendment is a matter reserved to the states.

Facts
Mrs. Myra Bradwell was denied an application to practice law in the Illinois Supreme Court.  Her petition included the requisite certificate attesting to her good character and qualifications.  The United States Supreme Court affirmed.

Issue
Does the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provide that one of the privileges and immunities of women as citizens is to engage in any profession?

Held
The admission to the bar is a matter reserved to the states and Bradwell’s right to practice law is not protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.

Concurrence
Justice Bradley.  The Illinois Supreme Court requires a certificate from the court of some county of his good moral character, and is otherwise left to the discretion of the court.  The court found itself bound by two limitations: to promote the proper administration of justice not to admit any class of persons not intended by the legislature to be admitted, even though not expressly excluded by statute.

Discussion
The purpose of this concurring opinion is to demonstrate a classic statement of separate spheres ideology.
