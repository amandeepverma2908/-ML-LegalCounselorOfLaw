228 N.J. Super. 566,550 A.2d 525,1988 N.J. Super.

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff filed for divorce and included in her complaint four personal injury counts alleging that her husband, Defendant, transmitted genital herpes to her during their marriage.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The determination of if sexual relationships between spouses constitute marital or nuptial privileges thereby entitling any sexual tort committed upon a spouse to interspousal immunity is determined based on the facts of each case.

Facts
Plaintiff filed for divorce and included in her complaint four personal injury counts alleging that her husband, Defendant, transmitted genital herpes to her during their marriage.  Defendant brought a motion for summary judgment dismissing the personal injury counts.

Issue
Do sexual relationships between spouses constitute marital or nuptial privileges thereby entitling any sexual tort committed upon a spouse to interspousal immunity?

Held
The marital privilege of sexual relations does not include immunity to personal injury suits between spouses based upon the transmission of a sexual disease.

Discussion
Marital or nuptial privileges are applied based on the facts of the case.  In the present case Defendant knowingly placed his wife at risk, and therefore cannot claim that the injury that occurred is protected by immunity solely because it occurred during marital sexual relations.
