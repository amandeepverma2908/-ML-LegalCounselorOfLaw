345 S.C. 8,546 S.E.2d 191,2001 S.C.

Brief Fact Summary
Appellant brought suit against her husband for injuries that occurred to her while the husband was driving.  She brought suit in South Carolina, but because the injury occurred in Georgia, Georgia’s interspousal immunity law was applicable.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
South Carolina refused to enforce Georgia’s interspousal immunity law on public policy grounds because it was based on outdated legal theory and the modern reasons for its continuance were untenable.

Facts
Appellant Juanita Boone was injured in a car accident in Georgia where she was a passenger in a vehicle driven by her husband, Respondent Freddie Boone.  Appellant brought suit against her husband in South Carolina where the parties resided.  The trial judge granted Respondent’s motion to dismiss based on Georgia law, which provides for interspousal immunity.

Issue
Does Georgia’s interspousal immunity from personal injury actions violate the public policy of South Carolina?

Held
Because the Georgia’s interspousal immunity is contrary to natural justice, a wife is not precluded from maintaining an action for personal injury against her husband.

Discussion
The Court refused to apply Georgia law even though it would normally have been applicable in this action because it felt that the law was against the State’s public policy.
