3 F.3d 439; 1993 U.S. App.

Brief Fact Summary
Appellant appeals the murder trial of her husband, claiming that an expert witness should have been permitted to testify about battered-woman syndrome.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Jurisdictions are divided on the admissibility of expert testimony regarding battered-woman syndrome.  To be admissible, expert testimony must meet three criteria: 1) the expert is qualified to give an opinion on the subject matter; 2) the state of the art or scientific knowledge permits a reasonable opinion to be given by the expert; 3) the subject matter of the expert opinion is so related to some science, profession, business, or occupation as to be beyond the understanding of the average layman.

Facts
Appellant’s first trial for the murder of her husband was overturned.  In this second trial, appellant argues that the trial court erred in disallowing testimony of a clinical psychologist who would have testified as an expert with regard to battered women’s syndrome.

Issue
Is expert testimony regarding battered women’s syndrome admissible in a murder trial in which the defendant claims self-defense?

Held
Such testimony is permissible if the court determines that expert is qualified and the expert’s methodology is generally accepted.

Discussion
This Court acknowledged that battered-woman syndrome was a subject outside the understanding of the average layman, but remanded the case so that the trial court could determine if the expert witness was qualified, and if her methodology was generally acceptable.
