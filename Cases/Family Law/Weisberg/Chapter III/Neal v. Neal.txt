941 S.W.2d 501,1997 Mo.

Brief Fact Summary
Wife and Husband separated while Wife was pregnant.  Wife petitioned to have her surname changed back to her maiden name, and placed her maiden name as surname for her son upon his birth.  The trial court refused to grant Wife’s requested name change, and changed the child’s name to Husband’s surname.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Due to clear legislative intent, a general concern of potential detriment is insufficient to prevent an individual’s name change.  However, proper notice is required for a child’s name change.

Facts
Melissa Neal and Bruce Neal separated in 1995 while she was pregnant.  Wife petitioned for dissolution of marriage and requested orders relative to the minor child and restoration of her maiden name.  Husband denied that the marriage was irretrievably broken and requested dismissal of Wife’s petition.  Upon birth of the parties’ son Wife denominated her surname, Gintz, as the child’s surname on his birth certificate.  During a decree of dissolution the court ordered the surname of the minor child changed to Neal.  Wife appealed.

Issue
Did the trial court err in refusing to restore her maiden name, Gintz? Did the trial court err by granting Husband’s request to change the child’s surname to Neal?

Held
The trial court erred both in its denial of the petition for Wife to change her name and its granting of Husband’s request to change the child’s surname.

Discussion
Although a court has discretion to not allow a person to change their name because it would be detrimental, the scope of the discretion is narrow.  In order to change a child’s name, proper notice must be given to concerned parties.
