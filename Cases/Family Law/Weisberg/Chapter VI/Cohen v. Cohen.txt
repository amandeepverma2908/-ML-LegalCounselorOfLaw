Brief Fact Summary
Husband challenged a court of appeals decision awarding his wife an interest in his unvested retirement benefits upon divorce.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Marital property includes retirement benefits, both vested and unvested which accrue during the marriage.

Facts
Pamela and Jay Cohen married on September 1, 1982, with Mr. Cohen finding employment with Nashville Metropolitan Fire Department.  In April, 1987, the department began making monthly contributions to the retirement plan on Cohen’s behalf.  In January 1992 Mrs. Cohen filed for divorce, and the trial court failed to award her any interest in her husband’s unvested retirement benefits.  The Court of Appeals reversed.

Issue
Was the Court of Appeals correct in determining that unvested retirement benefits are included as marital property?

Held
The court was correct in awarding wife an interest in her husband’s retirement benefits.

Discussion
The majority rule is exemplified in this case in that both vested and unvested retirement benefits may be distributable upon divorce.
