919 S.W.2d 340,1995 Tenn. App.

Brief Fact Summary
Mr. Turner appealed the trial court’s denial of his right to visitation based upon his failure to pay his child support obligation.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The court erred by denying visitation without a determination that Mr. Turner was financially able to support his children but refused to do so.

Facts
Rebecca and Charles Turner were married and had two children before separating in 1984.  In 1990, the trial court awarded Ms. Turner custody of the children, granted Mr. Turner visitation rights, and ordered him to pay child support and the children’s medical insurance.  The trial court denied Mr. Turner’s post-trial motion to alter or amend the child support award, but granted him additional visitation.  In November 1990, Ms. Turner sought to have Mr. Turner held in contempt for being in arrears in his child support.  Mr. Turner admitted he was delinquent and requested a reduction because he was financially unable to comply with the order.  He paid all child support due through November 1990, and agreed to pay for the children’s medical expenses.  In January 1991, the court found Mr. Turner in contempt for failing to pay child support and obtain medical insurance for his children.  The court did not act on Mr. Turner’s petition to modify child support because he came to court
