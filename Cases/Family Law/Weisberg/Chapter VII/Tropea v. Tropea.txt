Brief Fact Summary
Two cases are analyzed in which the custodial parent requested permission from the court to move out of the area with the children in opposition to a custody order.  In both cases the father appealed.<span class="heading">Synopsis of Rule of Law.</span> Rather than applying the three-step meaningful access exceptional-circumstances analysis, each relocation request must be considered on its own merits with due consideration of all the relevant facts and circumstances and with predominant emphasis being placed on what outcome is most likely to serve the best interests of the child.

Facts
This is a conciliation of two cases in which the divorced spouse who previously granted custody of the coupleâ€™s minor offspring seeks permission to move away from the area in which the noncustodial spouse resides.

Issue
Were the courts correct in applying the three-step meaningful access exceptional circumstance analysis in the above cases?

Discussion
The Court uses the two cases to demonstrate that a specific formula for determining when a move by a custodial parent will be permitted is inappropriate, but rather each determination must be made based on the individual facts of the case based upon the best interests of the child.
