405 U.S. 438,92 S. Ct. 1029,31 L. Ed. 2d 349,1972 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
Appellee was convicted for exhibiting and distributing contraceptive articles under a law that forbid single as opposed to married people from obtaining contraceptives.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Dissimilar treatment between married and unmarried persons is unconstitutional when the dissimilar treatment is unrelated to a rational State objective.

Facts
Appellee William Baird was convicted under a Massachusetts State law for exhibiting contraceptive articles and for giving a woman a package of Emko vaginal foam.  The Massachusetts Supreme Court set aside the conviction for exhibiting contraceptives on the grounds that it violated Appellee’s First Amendment rights, but sustained the conviction for giving away the foam.  The law permitted married persons to obtain contraceptives to prevent pregnancy, but forbid single persons from obtaining them.

Issue
Is there a rational ground for the different treatment of married and unmarried persons under the Massachusetts State law?

Held
The dissimilar treatment of similarly situated married and unmarried persons under the Massachusetts law violates the Equal Protection Clause.

Dissent
Chief Justice Burger.  The law is a justified exercise of the State’s police power because of the hazards of introducing a foreign substance into the human body.

Discussion
The right of privacy is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted government intrusion.
