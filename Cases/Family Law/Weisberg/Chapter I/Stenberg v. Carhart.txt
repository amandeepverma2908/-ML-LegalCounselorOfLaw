Brief Fact Summary
A doctor who performs abortions attempted to have a Nebraska  statute preventing partial birth abortions deemed unconstitutional.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
All statutes restricting abortion must allow an exception for the life and health of the mother.

Facts
Dr. Leroy Carhart, a Nebraska physician who performs abortions, brought a lawsuit seeking declaration that a Nebraska abortion statute violates the United States Constitution and asking for an injunction against its enforcement.  The District Court held the law unconstitutional, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

Issue
Does a Nebraska Statute prohibiting partial birth abortions violate the Constitution?

Held
The Statute violates the Constitution both because it lacks any exception for the preservation of the health of the mother, and because it unduly burdens the right to choose abortion by forbidding partial birth abortions.

Dissent
Demanding a health exception will allow live-birth abortions.  The decision is policy couched in law, and would be best left to the legislatures.

Concurrence
The statute does not save any fetus from destruction, and is only and attempt to chip away at abortion rights.

Discussion
The majority finds that although the details are gruesome, a calculated examination of the statute demonstrates that its protection for the mother is insufficient and its potential to persecute physicians is great.
