987 S.W.2d 772,1999 Ky.

Brief Fact Summary
Appellee and appellant were engaged to be married, but the relationship broke down.  Appellee sued under the common law action of Breach of Promise to Marry, and appellant moved for summary judgment.  The trial court granted appellant’s motion, the court of appeals reversed.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Breach of Promise to Marry is an outdated common law action that should no longer be permitted.

Facts
Ms. Barkes, appellee, and Dr. Gilbert, appellant, entered into a relationship resulting in appellant proposing to appellee.  Appellee accepted the proposal, and upon appellant’s insistence took early retirement and sold her home, moving in with appellant.  The parties’ relationship deteriorated and appellee moved out of appellant’s home.  Appellee brought an action for Breach of Promise to Marry (BPM).  The trial court granted appellant’s motion for summary judgment, the court of appeals reversed.

Issue
Should the cause of action for breach of promise to marry be abolished from Kentucky common law?

Held
BPM has become an anachronism that has outlived its usefulness and should be abolished.

Discussion
The Court stresses that its decision does not preclude the availability of other remedies, but only modifies the form the remedy may take.
