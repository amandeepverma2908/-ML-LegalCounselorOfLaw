482 U.S. 78,107 S. Ct. 2254,96 L. Ed. 2d 64,1987 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
Inmates brought suit over a Missouri Corrections regulation that permitted inmates to marry only with permission of the prison superintendent and allowed for approval only when compelling reasons exist.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The reason for the rule did not have a reasonable relationship to the goals of the penal system, therefore the prisonerâ€™s constitutional right to marriage was violated.

Facts
The Missouri Division of Corrections had regulations permitting inmates to marry only with the permission of the superintendent of the prison, and allowing for such approval only when there are compelling reasons to do so.  Prison officials testified that generally only a pregnancy or the birth of an illegitimate child where considered compelling.  Plaintiff inmates brought a class action suit for injunctive relief and damages.

Issue
Should a different rule apply in a prison forum that does not include marriage as a constitutionally protected right?

Held
Multiple elements of marriage that are not inconsistent with the status of a prisoner are sufficient to form a constitutionally protected right to marriage.  Even under a reasonable relationship test, the marriage regulation does not withstand scrutiny.

Discussion
The Court did not reach the question of if a higher standard of scrutiny is necessary because it found that the rule did not pass muster under the reasonable relationship test.  However, the Court did state that the regulation may impose an unacceptable constitutional restriction on non-prisoners because they would be unable to marry incarcerated individuals.
