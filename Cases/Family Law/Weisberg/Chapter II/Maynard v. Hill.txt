Facts
A brief discussion regarding the legal nature of marriage.

Issue
Is marriage a contract, a status, or does it retain features of both?

Held
Marriage is more than a mere contract.  Although it requires consent of two parties, it creates a relation between the parties that cannot be changed.  Marriage is an institution, a social relationship comparable to that between a parent and a child.

Discussion
This is a short excerpt from a case addressing the nature of marriage.  The decision addressed the fact that although marriage is often termed as a civil contract, the rights, duties and obligations established are those of law, not of contract.
