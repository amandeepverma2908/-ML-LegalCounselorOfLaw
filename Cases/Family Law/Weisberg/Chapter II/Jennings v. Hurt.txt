Brief Fact Summary
Jennings and Hurt met when Hurt was married.  The couple lived together in South Carolina, and Hurt stated that they were married in the eyes of God after his divorce.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In a relationship where one of the parties was already married, the party claiming a common-law marriage must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the relationship underwent some fundamental change following the removal of the impediment

Facts
Jennings and Hurt met in New York in 1981 and began living together.  They ceased living together in 1984.  When the relationship began Jennings knew Hurt was still married.  Hurt explained that marriage was not in the cards.  In spring of 1982 Jennings became pregnant, prompting Hurt to commence divorce proceedings to terminate his marriage.  In October 1982 Jennings joined Hurt in South Carolina until January of 1983, where they shared the same house and bed.  In December 1982 Jennings learned that Hurt’s divorce was final when he approached her with a pre-nuptial agreement and said that they should sign the agreement, have blood tests, and get married.  After they went to a Notary Republic to have the agreement signed a fight ensued regarding the agreement, and Hurt stated that they were married in the eyes of God.  Jennings claims to be Hurt’s common-law wife based on these events.

Issue
Is Jennings the common-law wife of Hurt?

Held
The evidence is insufficient to prove that a common-law marriage was established.

Discussion
The court determines that although New York recognizes common-law marriages established in other states, the evidence is insufficient to establish a common-law marriage was established when the couple lived in South Carolina.
