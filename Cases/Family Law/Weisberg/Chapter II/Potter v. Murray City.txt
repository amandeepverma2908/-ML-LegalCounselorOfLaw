Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff, a police officer in Utah, was fired for practicing polygamy.  He brought suit claiming that laws prohibiting plural marriage were invalid.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
States may show a compelling interest to uphold a law by demonstrating that the value the law protects has historically been widely held by the people.

Facts
Plaintiff, a former police officer in Utah, was terminated by the city after it learned that he practiced plural marriage.  Plaintiff sought monetary damages against the City, the Chief of Police, and the Civil Service Commission.  He also sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the State, its Governor, and Attorney General to determine that laws prohibiting plural marriage were invalid and to enjoin their enforcement.

Issue
Should the constitutional right to privacy be extended to protect polygamous marriages?

Held
Neither the Free Exercise Clause nor the Right to Privacy prohibits the State from legislating against polygamy.

Discussion
Because a ban on plural marriage is “inextricably woven into the fabric of our society,” the State is justified by a compelling interest to uphold this ban.
