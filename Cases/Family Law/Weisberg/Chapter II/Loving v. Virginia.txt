388 U.S. 1,87 S. Ct. 1817,18 L. Ed. 2d 1010,1967 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
An African-American woman and a Caucasian man were charged and pled guilty to a Virginia statute banning interracial marriages.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Equal Protection Clause calls for strict scrutiny when laws contain classification based upon race.  Such laws are only upheld if a legitimate state interest independent of the racial discrimination exists.

Facts
Jeter, an African-American woman, and Loving, a Caucasian man, were married in 1958 in the District of Columbia.  Both where residents of Virginia.  The couple returned to Virginia and was charged with violating the state ban on interracial marriages.  The Lovings pled guilty and were sentenced to a one year suspended sentence so long as they leave the state and not return for twenty five years.

Issue
Does the Virginia statute prohibiting marriages solely on the basis of racial classification violate the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment?

Held
The Fourteenth Amendment does not permit the freedom of choice to marry to be restricted by racial discrimination.

Discussion
The Court found that even if the statute punished Caucasian and African-American participants equally, it was still subject to strict scrutiny.  The state had no legitimate independent reason for the invidious racial discrimination, therefore the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause.
