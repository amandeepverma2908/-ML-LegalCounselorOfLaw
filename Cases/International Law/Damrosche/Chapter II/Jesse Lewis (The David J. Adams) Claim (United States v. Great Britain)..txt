Facts
In the Treaty of London of 1818, the United States (P) agreed that its citizens would not fish in Canadian (D) waters. Precisely in 1886, an American fishing schooner was seized by Canadian (D) authorities for allegedly violating the Treaty. After finding that the vessel had indeed violated the Treaty and Canadian legislation, A Canadian (D) court condemned the vessel.

Issue
Is it the duty of an international tribunal to determine, from an international perspective, how he provisions of a treaty are to be interpreted and applied to the facts?

Held
Yes. The determination, from an international perspective, of how the provisions of a treaty are to be interpreted and applied to the facts is the duties of an international tribunal. The unilateral interpretation of a bilateral contract by one party is not binding on the other party. The fact that the international was given by legislative or judicial authority does not make it enforceable on the other party.

Discussion
The Tribunal found that the Canadian (D) did not err in its interpretation. Some courts have held that unilateral interpretations of treaties have only an advisory effect. Others opine that such interpretations are to be seen as amendments to the treaty.
