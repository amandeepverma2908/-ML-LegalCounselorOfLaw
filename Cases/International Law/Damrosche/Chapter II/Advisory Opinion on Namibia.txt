Brief Fact Summary
Under a claim of right to annex Namibia, South Africa occupied its territory in violation of a United Nations (U.N.) Security Council Mandate which though later terminated due to South Africa’s breach, empowered the Security Council to enforce its terms.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Member States of the United Nations are bounded by its mandates and violations or breaches results in a legal obligation on the part of the violator to rectify the violation and upon the other Member States to recognize the conduct as a violation and to refuse to aid in such violation.

Facts
Under a claim of right to annex the Namibian territory and under the claim that Namibia’s nationals desired South Africa’s (D) rule, South Africa (D) began the occupation of Namibia. South Africa was subject to a U.N. Mandate prohibiting Member States from taking physical control of other territories because it was a Member State of the United Nations.

Issue
Issue: are mandates adopted by the United Nations binding upon all  Member States so as to make breaches or violations thereof result in a  legal obligation on the part of the violator to rectify the violation  and upon other Member States to recognize the conduct as a violation and  to refuse to aid in such violations?

Held
Yes. Member States of the United Nations are bounded by its mandates and violations or breaches results in a legal obligation on the part of the violator to rectify the violation and upon the other Member States to recognize the conduct as a violation and to refuse to aid in such violation. As Member States, the obligation to keep intact and preserve the rights of other States and the people in them has been assumed.

Discussion
Despite agreeing to restore independence to Namibia with the United Nations, South Africa (D) did not. A number of mandatory sanctions for enforcement were now adopted by the General Assembly and the action of South Africa (D) was “strongly condemned”.
