Brief Fact Summary
After the United States (P) seized their fishing vessels, the owners (D) argued that international law exempted coastal fishermen from capture as prizes of war.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Exemptions from capture as prizes of war includes coastal fishing vessels, their cargoes and their crews.

Facts
an appeal of a district court decree condemning two fishing vessels and their cargoes as prizes of war was brought by the owners (D) of two separate fishing vessels. Each of the vessels were fishing smack that were sailing under the Spanish flag, running in and out of Havana and these vessels regularly engaged in fishing on the coast of Cuba.

Issue
does exemptions from capture as prizes of war includes coastal fishing vessels, their cargoes and crews?

Held
(Gray, J.) Yes. Exemption from capture as prizes of war includes coastal fishing vessels, their cargoes and their crews. This doctrine above has been familiar to the United States from the time of the War of Independence, and has been recognized explicitly by the French and British governments.

Discussion
the Chief Justice Fuller argued that the captured vessels were of such a size and range which did not fall within the exemption. This dissenting opinion was not captured in the main book of this casebook. That the exemption in any case had not become a customary rule of international law and the fact that it was only an “act of grace” that had not been authorized by the President, was also contended by the Chief Justice.
