Issue
Does the corpus of international law which relates to the environment now consists of the general obligations of states to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction and control respects the environment of other states or areas beyond national control?

Held
Yes. The corpus of international law which relates to the environment now consists of the general obligation of states to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction and control respects the environment of other states or areas beyond national control. The concept of sustainable development is in consonance with the need to reconcile economic development with the protection of the environment. Hence, the terms of agreements to implement must be negotiated by the parties.

Discussion
The need for both environmental protection and economic development was confirmed by the Court. A Chamber on Environmental Matters was established by the Court in 1993. In this case, the Court found that neither of the party could singlehandedly revoke the treaty.
