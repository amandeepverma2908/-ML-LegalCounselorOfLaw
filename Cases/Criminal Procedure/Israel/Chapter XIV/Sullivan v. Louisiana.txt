Brief Fact Summary
An individual was charged with first-degree murder during the course of the robbery of a bar.  At trial, the jury instructions included a definition of reasonable doubt that was previously found unconstitutional.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
“[T]he reviewing court [should] consider [ ] not what effect the constitutional error might generally be expected to have upon a reasonable jury, but rather what effect it had upon the guilty verdict in the case at hand.”

Facts
The Petitioner, Sullivan (the “Petitioner”), was charged with first-degree murder during the course of the robbery of a bar.  The Petitioner’s alleged accomplice, Michael Hillhouse (”Hillhouse”) testified during trial pursuant to a grant of immunity.  The bar was crowded, but only one witness testified during trial.  The witness could not identify either the Petitioner or Hillhouse during a physical line up, but testified that he saw the Petitioner hold a gun to the victim’s head.  In his closing argument, the defense counsel argued there was reasonable doubt as to the identity of the murderer and his intent.

Issue
“[W]hether a constitutionally deficient reasonable doubt instruction may be harmless error[?]”

Held
The majority observed the “prosecution bears the burden of proving all elements of the offense charged and must persuade the factfinder ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ of the facts necessary to establish each of those elements.”

Discussion
This case deals with the effects that errors during trial have when an appellate court is reviewing the case.
