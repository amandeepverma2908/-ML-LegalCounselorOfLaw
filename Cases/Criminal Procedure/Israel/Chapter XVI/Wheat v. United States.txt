Brief Fact Summary
Petitioner, Wheat, desired to hire Iredale, the attorney who was already representing two other defendants to various crimes all arising out of the same course of events.  The District Court denied petitioner’s request, citing conflict of interest, and petitioner appealed.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
“While the right to select and be represented by one’s preferred attorney is comprehended by the Sixth Amendment, the essential aim of the Amendment is to guarantee an effective advocate for each criminal defendant rather than to ensure that a defendant will inexorably be represented by the lawyer whom he prefers.”

Facts
Petitioner, along with other co-defendants, was charged with participation in a drug conspiracy.  Two other defendants, Gomez-Barajas and Bravo were represented by attorney Eugene Iredale, and petitioner also wished to be represented by this attorney.

Dissent
Justices Marshall and Stevens both wrote dissenting opinions, maintaining that the while the District Court may be given latitude to abrogate a defendant’s choice in counsel in the case of true, undeniable conflict; the facts of this case were given greater significance and, no true conflict existed at the time of trial.

Discussion
Its important to remember that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel may always be circumvented by the court’s duty to determine whether defendants are being provided with effective assista
