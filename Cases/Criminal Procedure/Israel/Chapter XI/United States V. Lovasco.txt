434 U.S. 881, 98 S. Ct. 242, 54 L. Ed. 2d 164 (1977)

Brief Fact Summary
Respondent, Lovasco, brought this action when he was indicted eighteen (18) months after the offenses of his indictment occurred.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A court must apply a balancing test and consider not only the prejudice to the defendant but also the governmental interests that are being served when there is a delay in indictment.

Facts
Between July and August of 1973, it was found that respondent possessed eight firearms, stolen from the United States mail and that he had been dealing in firearms without a license.  Respondent was not indicted until March of 1975, and he moved to dismiss due to delay.  Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals found that the Respondent offered sufficient evidence that he had been prejudiced by the delay and both refused to consider the government’s contention that it was waiting on additional evidence before bringing indictment.

Issue
Whether prejudice to the defendant, alone, is enough to dismiss a case for lack of a speedy trial.

Held
Reversed.  By looking at several factors, the Supreme Court, in an opinion authored by Justice Marshall, found there to be a balancing test to determine what is “speedy” in the context of the constitutional mandate for a speedy trial-in addition to the prejudice the defendant faces, the following interests of justice must also be considered:

Discussion
While there is a constitutional right to a speedy trial, the government should also be afforded the right to fully develop its case.
