Brief Fact Summary
The police were invited into the apartment of the respondent, Edward Rodriguez (the “respondent”), by a third party.  Without a warrant, the police entered the apartment and found drugs and related materials.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Warrantless searches of a premises are permitted when police have a reasonable belief that voluntary consent was obtained from a party who possesses common authority over the premises.

The majority notes that some circumstances may favor a finding of an unreasonable search even when the police are given express permission.  Further, the burden is on the state to establish common authori
