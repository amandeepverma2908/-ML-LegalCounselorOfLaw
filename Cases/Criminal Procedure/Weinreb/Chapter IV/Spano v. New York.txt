Brief Fact Summary
An individual was accused of murdering another individual after the victim took his money from a bar.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
“[The] petitioner’s will was overborne by official pressure, fatigue and sympathy falsely aroused, after considering all the facts in their post-indictment setting.”

Facts
The Petitioner, Vincent Spano (the “Petitioner”), was born in Italy, but is a citizen of the United States.  The Petitioner was accused of shooting a boxer who took his money from a bar.  The Petitioner followed the victim out of the bar to get his money back and an altercation ensued, during which the boxer knocked the Petitioner down and hit him several times.  The Petitioner was beaten severely by the boxer.  After the altercation, the Petitioner went home and got a gun and thereafter shot the boxer.  The Petitioner found the boxer in a store and the only witness was a boy who was supervising the store.  The Petitioner thereafter disappeared for about a week.

Issue
“[W]hether [the] confession was properly admitted into evidence under the Fourteenth Amendment[?]”

Held
The conviction cannot stand.  “As in all such cases, we are forced to resolve a conflict between two fundamental interests of society; its interest in prompt and efficient law enforcement, and its interest in preventing the rights of its individual members from being abridged by unconstitutional methods of law enforcement.”
