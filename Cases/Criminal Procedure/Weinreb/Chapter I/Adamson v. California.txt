Brief Fact Summary
Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder in California state court after his refusal to take the stand and testify was commented on by opposing trial counsel.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is not a part of the right to a fair trial protected by the Due Process clause of Fourteenth Amendment.

Facts
At murder trial, appellant chose the strategy of not taking the stand and subjecting himself to cross-examination regarding former crimes of burglary, larceny and robbery that he had committed.  Under a California statute, his attempt to protect himself from impeachment of his veracity nonetheless allowed prosecution to make reference to his refusal to testify, and he was convicted.  Appellant argues that the California statute’s allowing opposing counsel to comment on his refusal to testify ran counter to the Fifth Amendment’s ban on a defendant’s compulsion to testify, and that the Fifth Amendment applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.

Issue
Is the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment and thus applicable to the states?

Held
No.  The court affirms the appellant’s conviction.

Concurrence
J. Frankfurter.  Do not force the states to include the specific provisions of the Bills of Rights into their lawmaking.  The Fourteenth Amendment’s definition of due process is enough of a guiding hand to this court on whether a state has violated constitutional rights.

Discussion
Although this case embraced selective incorporation in stating that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination did not apply to the states through the Fourteenth, subsequent cases held that comment upon a defendant’s failure to take the stand was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
