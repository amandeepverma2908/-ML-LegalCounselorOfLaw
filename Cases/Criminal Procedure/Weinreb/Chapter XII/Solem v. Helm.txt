Brief Fact Summary
An individual with a criminal history of non-violent felonies was subject to a recidivism statute after being convicted of another felony.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
“[A]s a matter of principle[,] a criminal sentence must be proportionate to the crime for which the defendant has been convicted.”

Facts
The Respondent, Jerry Helm (the “Respondent”), was convicted of six nonviolent felonies.  Due to his criminal history, the Respondent was subject to a recidivist statute after being accused of uttering a “no account check” that read:  “[w]hen a defendant has been convicted of at least three prior convictions [sic] in addition to the principal felony, the sentence for the principal felony shall be enhanced to the sentence for a Class 1 felony.”  The maximum penalty for the crime of uttering a “no account check” is five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.  The maximum fine for a “Class 1″ felony was life imprisonment and a $25,000 fine.  Further, parole is not available.  Only the Governor is authorized to pardon prisoners.

Issue
“[W]hether the Eighth Amendment proscribes a life sentence without possibility of parole for a seventh nonviolent felony[?]”

Held
Yes.  “The principle that a punishment should be proportionate to the crime is deeply rooted and frequently repeated in common-law jurisprudence.”

Discussion
This case confronts the proportionality requirement of the Eighth Amendment when it comes to sentencing.
