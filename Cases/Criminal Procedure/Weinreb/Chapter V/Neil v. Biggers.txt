Brief Fact Summary
The constitutionality of a station house identification by the victim of a rape was at issue.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
“Weighing all the factors, [there is] no substantial likelihood of misidentification.”

Facts
The Respondent was convicted of rape and imprisoned for twenty years.  Part of the state’s evidence was a station house identification by the victim.  The Respondent brought a federal habeus corpus action.  The District Court held that the station house identification procedure was so suggestive as to violate due process.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Issue
Whether the station house identification procedure was so suggestive (not reliable) to violate due process?

Held
The majority observed “first of all, [it is] apparent that the primary evil to be avoided is ‘a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.’ ”  “What is less clear from our cases is whether, as intimated by the District Court, unnecessary suggestiveness alone requires the exclusion of evidence.”  “The purpose of a strict rule barring evidence of unnecessarily suggestive confrontations would be to deter the police from using a less reliable procedure where a more reliable one may be available, and would not be based on the assumption that in every instance the admission of evidence of such a confrontation offends due process.”

Discussion
This case provides an interesting discussion of how pre-trial identifications are construed by the courts.
