Brief Fact Summary
The constitutionality of various statements made by suspected drug dealers was at issue.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
“[V]erbal evidence which derives so immediately from an unlawful entry and an unauthorized arrest as the officers’ action in the present case is no less the ‘fruit’ of official illegality than the more common tangible fruits of the unwarranted intrusion.”

Facts
Hom Way (”Way”) was found with heroin in his possession after being under surveillance by federal narcotics officer for six weeks.  Way told the officer that he bought heroin from someone named “Blackie Toy.”  After obtaining this information, six or seven federal agents went to the location where Way said he purchased the heroin.  It was a Laundromat operated by James Wah Toy (”Toy”).  There is nothing in the record that says Toy and “Blackie Toy” are the same person.  One agent went to the front door and announced that he was a federal narcotics agent.  When that occurred, Toy slammed the door and began running toward his living quarters in the back of the Laundromat.  The agent who approached the door and other agents followed Toy into the bedroom.  Toy reached into a nightstand drawer and was arrested.  There was nothing in the drawer and there were no narcotics found on the premises.  The officers informed Toy that Way said he purchased narcotics from him.  Toy said that

Issue
“[W]hether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint[?]”

Held
The majority began by pointing out the differences in Toy and Wong Suns’ cases and how they had to discuss each individually.

Discussion
This is one of the Supreme Court’s seminal cases on the fruits of the poisonous tree doctrine.
