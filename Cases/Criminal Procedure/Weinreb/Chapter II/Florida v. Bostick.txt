Brief Fact Summary
Police officers, without an articulable suspicion, approached an individual on a bus and asked him questions and to search his luggage.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
“[N]o seizure occurs when police ask questions of an individual, ask to examine the individual’s identification, and request consent to search his or her luggage – so long as the officers do not convey a message that compliance with their requests is required.”

Facts
Police officers boarded a bus on route to Atlanta from Miami and discovered cocaine in a suitcase belonging to Terrance Bostwick (”Mr. Bostwick”).  The police officers approached Mr. Bostwick without an articulable suspicion.  The officers identified themselves as narcotics agents, inspected his ticket which matched his identification, but still asked Mr. Bostwick’s permission to search his bags.

Issue
Can officers approach individuals at random on buses to ask them questions and to request consent to search their luggage so long as a reasonable person would understand that he or she could refuse to cooperate?

Held
Yes.  The majority first observed that a seizure does not occur “simply because a police officer approaches an individual and asks a few questions.”  Especially when “a reasonable person would feel free to disregard the police and go about his business, the encounter is consensual, and no reasonable suspicion is required.”

Discussion
It is interesting to read the majority and dissenting opinions alongside one another to see the tests the respective justices would apply.
