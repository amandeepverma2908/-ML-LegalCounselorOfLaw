Brief Fact Summary
After learning that an assault was committed, a police officer asked an individual to provide his name, but the individual refused.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Neither the Fourth or Fifth Amendment is violated when an individual can be arrested for not providing their name to an officer after the officer asks for it.

Facts
The police received a phone call reporting an assault.  The caller reported seeing a man assault a woman in a red and silver GMC truck.  An officer was sent to the site to investigate and he saw a truck matching the description parked on the side of the road.  There were skid marks near the car leading the office to believe that the truck had come to a sudden stop.  A man was standing near the truck and a woman was inside.  The officer asked the man for his identification eleven times, but the man refused to provide any.  The man began to taunt the officer by telling him to arrest him and take him into jail.  The officer eventually arrested the man for his failure to comply.

Discussion
In the context of the Fifth Amendment the majority observes “a case may arise where there is a substantial allegation that furnishing identity at the time of a stop would have given the police a link in the chain of evidence needed to convict the individual of a separate offense. In that case, the court can then consider whether the privilege applies, and, if the Fifth Amendment has been violated, what remedy must follow.”
