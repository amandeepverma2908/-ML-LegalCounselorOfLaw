Brief Fact Summary
An individual was accused of rape and one piece of evidence used to accuse him was a .22-caliber rifle found in his grandmothers home.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
“A search conducted in reliance upon a warrant cannot later be justified on the basis of consent if it turns out that the warrant was invalid.”

Facts
The petitioner lived with his grandmother, a 66-year-old negro widow, in a rural area.  Two days after an alleged rape, four white police officers went to the widow’s house and her that they had a search warrant to search her house.  She told them they could conduct their search and they found a .22 caliber rifle gun eventually introduced into evidence.

Issue
“[W]hether a search can be justified as lawful on the basis of consent when that ‘consent’ has been given only after the official conducting the search has asserted that he possesses a warrant?

Held
No, “there can be no consent under such circumstances.”

Discussion
It is interesting to recognize that the court in a footnote observed “Mrs. Leath owned both the house and the rifle. The petitioner concedes that her voluntary consent to the search would have been binding upon him. Conversely, there can be no question of the petitioner’s standing to challenge the lawfulness of the search. He was the ‘one against whom the search was directed,’ and the house searched was his home. The rifle was used by all members of the household and was found in the common part of the house.”
