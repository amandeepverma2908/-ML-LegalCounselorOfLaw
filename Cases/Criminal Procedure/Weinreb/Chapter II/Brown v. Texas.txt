Brief Fact Summary
A police officer, without any knowledge an individual was engaged in any legality, requested that the individual stop in an ally because he “looked suspicious”.  The individual refused to identify himself.

Facts
Two police officers observed the Appellant and another man walking in opposite directions from one another in an alley.  The officers believed the two men had met or were going to meet, but for seeing the police car the officers were riding in.  One of the police officers asked the Appellant to (i) identify himself and (ii) what he was doing there.  The officer testified that the Appellant “looked suspicious and we had never seen that subject in that area before.”  The area where the stop was made has a high incidence of drug traffic.  The officers did not “claim to suspect appellant of any specific misconduct, nor did they have any reason to believe that he was armed.”

Issue
“[W]hether appellant was validly convicted for refusing to comply with a policeman’s demand that he identify himself pursuant to a provision of the Texas Penal Code which makes it a crime to refuse such identification on request[?]”

Held
The majority first observed “[w]hen the officers detained appellant for the purpose of requiring him to identify himself, they performed a seizure of his person subject to the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.”  Further, “[t]he reasonableness of seizures that are less intrusive than a traditional arrest, depends ‘on a balance between the public interest and the individual’s right to personal security free from arbitrary interference by law officers.’ ”

Discussion
It is interesting to read this case along side Terry v. Ohio, which is the Supreme Court of the United States’ seminal decision on the stop and frisk doctrine.
