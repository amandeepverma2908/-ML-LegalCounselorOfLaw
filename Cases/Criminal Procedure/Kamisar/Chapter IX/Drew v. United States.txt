331 F.2d 85, 118 U.S. App. D.C. 11 (D.C. Cir. 1964)

Brief Fact Summary
Appellant, Drew, brought an appeal from a District Court conviction on one count of robbery and one count of attempted robbery, based on the fact that the counts were improperly joined.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Joinder is only proper when there is such a close resemblance in the manner in which two crimes were committed to make them admissible against one another.

Facts
On July 27, 1962, a robbery occurred at a neighborhood store after a black male, in sunglasses, entered the store and approached the clerk telling her that it was a holdup and he wanted all of the money.  The robber was given the money and proceeded to leave the store as another customer entered.  Two and a half weeks later, at another neighborhood store, another robbery was attempted when a black male, wearing a coat, a hat and sunglasses entered the store and asked for all the money.  That time, the clerk declined and after a verbal exchange, the frustrated robber left the store.
