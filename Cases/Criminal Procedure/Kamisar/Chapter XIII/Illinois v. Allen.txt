Brief Fact Summary
Defendant, Allen, appealed from a conviction he received after he was barred from his own trial for disrupting the judicial process.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
While there is a Sixth Amendment right to be present at one’s trial, that right is not absolute.

Facts
Allen was charged with armed robbery.  Before his trial, he obtained permission to conduct his own defense, as long as he allowed court-appointed counsel to sit in.  During voir dire, allen started to argue with the judge, and continued to be insubordinate throughout the opening of the trial.  After that, the judge ordered Allen removed from the court room and only allowed him in for identification and for portions of his defense.

Issue
Whether the Sixth Amendment gives a defendant an absolute right to attend his own trial.

Held
When a defendant refuses to conduct himself in an orderly manner, he can lose his Sixth Amendment right to be present at his own trial.

Discussion
The important thing to remember about this case is that the Sixth Amendment does not afford an absolute right to be present at one’s own trial.
