Brief Fact Summary

After holding that Bain was overruled as to the defective indictment depriving jurisdiction, the Court went on to analyize the present matter under the plain error test “of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) to respondents’ forfeited claim.”  Under that standard, the Court held that “the failure to include the amount of drugs in the indictment was not plain error.”
