395 U.S. 711, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656, 1969 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
The defendants, Clifton Pearce (”Mr. Pearce”) and William Rice (”Mr. Rice”) (collectively referred to as the “defendants”), successfully overturned initial convictions only to be reconvicted with longer sentences without credit for time served.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
