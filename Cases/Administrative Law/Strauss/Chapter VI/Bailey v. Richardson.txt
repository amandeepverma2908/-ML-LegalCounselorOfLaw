Brief Fact Summary
Bailey, a civil service employee of the United States Government,  was discharged from employ for allegedly having associations with Communist groups.  Bailey claimed that the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States  Constitution required that she be afforded a quasi-judicial hearing before dismissal.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The due process clause provides: “No person shall be  deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.” However, government  employ is not “property” under the Fifth Amendment, nor is it a contract.

Facts
The Regional Board advised the Federal Security Agency, by which Bailey was  employed, that it has reason to believe she was disloyal to the United States Government,  and instructed the Agency to separate her from service. Bailey appealed to the Loyalty  Review Board and requested a hearing, which was held before the panel without  testimony from any other witnesses besides Bailey. Bailey complained that her Fifth  Amendment due process right was violated because she was denied reinstatement without  revelation of the names of those who informed the Government against her, and the  methods by which her activities were detected.

Issue
Was the President required to either allow Bailey, a person whose loyalty he  reasonably suspected, to continue her employment, or to publicly reveal the methods by  which he detected disloyalty and the names of persons who assisted him?

Held
No. The due process of law clause of the Fifth Amendment does not restrict the  President’s discretion or the prescriptive power of Congress in respect to executive  personnel.     No hearing was required prior to termination, as government employment is  not a property right encompassed by the Fifth Amendment.      Dissent. Judge Edgerton’s dissent involved First and Sixth Amendments rights, and did  not address Bailey’s Fifth Amendment claims.    Concurrence. None.

Discussion
Even in normal times (without Communist threats), the ability, integrity and  loyalty of purely executive employees is exclusively for the executive branch of  Government to determine.
