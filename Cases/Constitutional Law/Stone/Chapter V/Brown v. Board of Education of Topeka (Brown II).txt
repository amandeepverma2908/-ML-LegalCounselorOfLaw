Brief Fact Summary
In [Brown I], the Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) held that racial discrimination in public education is unconstitutional.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In fashioning and effectuating decrees, which require varied solutions, the courts will be guided by equitable principles.

Facts
In Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (”Brown I”), the Supreme Court held that racial discrimination in public education is unconstitutional.

Issue
Given the decision in Brown I, in what manner should relief be accorded?

Held
The judgment in the Delaware Case, ordering the immediate admission of the Plaintiffs to previously segregated schools, is affirmed. The judgments below for all other cases are reversed and remanded to the District Courts to take such proceedings and enter such orders as necessary to and proper to desegregate the public schools with all deliberate speed.

Discussion
Brown II has been widely criticized as being too lenient. Since segregation in the public schools is unconstitutional, the argument runs, the Supreme Court cannot simply wait for the jurisdictions to “transition to a racially nondiscriminatory school system” (Brown II) “with all deliberate speed.” Questions also abound as to what time frame “all deliberate speed” constitutes.
