20 N.J.L. 368, 1845 N.J. Sup. Ct. 14.

Brief Fact Summary
In 1844, New Jersey amended its constitution to read that all men are by nature free and have certain inalienable rights such as to life, to liberty and to the pursuit of happiness. Abolitionists argued that slavery was thereby made illegal.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Laws must be read in accordance with the nature, the condition and laws of the society in which they are made.

Facts
In 1804, the New Jersey Legislature enacted an act for the gradual abolition of slavery. That statute provided that every child born a slave would become free by a certain specified date. At the date of the trial, a census showed that the number of slaves in the State had been reduced to 674. In 1844, New Jersey amended its constitution to read that all men are by nature free and have certain inalienable rights such as to life, to liberty and to the pursuit of happiness. Abolitionists argued that slavery was thereby made illegal.

Issue
Was the New Jersey constitutional amendment of 1844 enacted for the purpose of ending slavery?

Held
No.

Discussion
This case begs the question whether the author of the opinion was bound to reach the decision he did and whether judges should have done more to end slavery. The author is obviously persuaded by the fact that the effect of the act of 1804 was the continued existence of slavery in 1844, the date of the constitutional amendment. Could it be argued that a strict reading of the constitutional amendment and the “nature, the condition and the laws of the society” at the time of the amendment compelled a different conclusion? For example, the author could have given greater weight to the fact that slavery was almost phased out in New Jersey at the time of the constitutional amendment.
