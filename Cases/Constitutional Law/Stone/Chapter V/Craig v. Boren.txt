Brief Fact Summary
Oklahoma law prohibited the sale of beer to males under age 21 and to females under the age of 18.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
To justify a gender-based classification, a state law must be substantially related to the achievement of an important governmental objective.

Facts
Oklahoma law prohibited the sale of beer to males under age 21 and to females under the age of 18. The Appellee, the government (Appellee), alleged that the purpose of the classification was to enhance traffic safety. In support of its allegation, Appellee introduced statistical surveys showing that .18 % of females and .2% of males between the ages of 18-20 were arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.

Issue
Does the gender based differential constitute an unconstitutional denial of equal protection to males between the ages of 18 to 20?

Held
No. Oklahomaâ€™s law invidiously discriminates against males 18-20 years old.

Dissent
Justice William Rehnquist (J. Rehnquist) argues that the majority opinion is objectionable for two reasons. One, it concludes that in cases of men challenging gender-based discrimination, a more stringent standard of review is called for than is applied in cases involving most other types of classifications. Two, the Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) is enunciating a test, without citation, that classifications based on gender must be substantially related to important interests.

Discussion
This case establishes the current standard of review for gender-based classifications. The same standard applies without regard for which gender is being discriminated against.
