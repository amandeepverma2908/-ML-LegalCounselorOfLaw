481 U.S. 279, 107 S. Ct. 1756, 95 L. Ed. 2d 262, 1987 U.S. 1817.

Brief Fact Summary
The Petitioner, McCleskey (Petitioner), an African-American, was convicted in a Georgia state court of murdering a white person and sentenced to death. Relying on a statistical study of the application of the death penalty in Georgia, Petitioner argued that his sentence was the result of racial discrimination.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
To prevail under the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution (Constitution), a person must show that the decision makers in a particular case acted with discriminatory purpose.

Facts
The Petitioner, an African-American, was convicted in a Georgia state court of murdering a white person and sentenced to death. David Baldus (Baldus) produced a study (the “Baldus Study”) in which over 2,000 murder cases were examined in Georgia. Taking into account nonracial factors, Baldus concluded that blacks were 4.3 times more likely to receive the death penalty for killing whites than for killing other blacks. Petitioner, relying on the Baldus Study, claimed that the Georgia capital sentencing scheme was administered in a racially discriminatory way.

Issue
Were the statistics contained in the Baldus Study sufficient to demonstrate discriminatory intent on a particular instance on the part of the state of Georgia?

Held
No. The District Court and the Court of Appeals are affirmed.

Dissent
Justice William Brennan (J. Brennan) stated the conclusion suggested by the Baldus Study is consistent with our understanding of history and human experience in Georgia’s legacy of race-conscious criminal justice.

Discussion
Much ado is made by the Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) about the distinction between “purpose” and “effects.” In practical terms, the importance of the distinction really turns on the Supreme Court’s willingness to infer purpose from effects. In this case the Supreme Court was not so inclined.
