Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff, Dred Scott (Plaintiff), a slave, was taken by his former master from Missouri (a slave state) to Illinois (a free state), then to the Louisiana Territory (free territory) and then back to Missouri where he was sold to the Defendant, Sandford (Defendant). Plaintiff thereupon sued in federal court arguing that his trips to free territory made him free.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Blacks are not Citizens within the meaning of Article III of the United States Constitution (Constitution). A person cannot be dispossessed of his property merely because he takes his property into a particular territory consistent with Due Process.

Facts
Plaintiff, a slave, was taken by his former master from Missouri (a slave state) to Illinois (a free state), then to the Louisiana Territory (free territory) and then back to Missouri where he was sold to the Defendant a citizen of New York. Thereupon, Plaintiff brought suit for his freedom in the Circuit Court on the basis of Article III diversity jurisdiction, claiming that he was a citizen of Missouri. Plaintiff argued that his trips to “free” Illinois and the Louisiana Territory made him free. Defendant argued that even if Plaintiff was free, he was not a citizen of Missouri and therefore, that the Circuit Court lacked diversity jurisdiction over the case.

Issue

Held
No and No.
