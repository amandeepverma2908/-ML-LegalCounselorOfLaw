Brief Fact Summary
Washington law made it criminal for any person to knowingly cause or aid another person to attempt suicide. The constitutionality of the statute was brought into question.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
There is no fundamental right to a physician assisted suicide under the United States Constitution.

Facts
Washington law makes it criminal for any person to knowingly cause or aid another person to attempt suicide. Exempted under the State law, however, is the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment at a patient’s direction. The constitutionality of the statute was brought into question.

Issue
Was Washington’s prohibition of causing or aiding a suicide in violation of the substantive due process component of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution?

Held
No.

Discussion
This case explains the Supreme Court’s “assisted suicide” jurisprudence. The right to a physician assisted suicide is not so much characterized by the concept of “self-sovereignty” as the persons opposing the State law, Respondents, here would assert. Rather, whether the right exists under particular legal circumstances depends on the extent of recognition of the right in our Nation’s history and traditions.
