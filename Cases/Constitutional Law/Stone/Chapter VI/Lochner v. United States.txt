Brief Fact Summary
A New York statute regulated the number of hours bakers could work.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The right to make a contract in relation to one’s business, is a part of the liberty of the individual protected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution).

Facts
A New York statute provided that no employee shall work in a bakery more than 60 hours a week or 10 hours a day. The stated purpose of the statute was to protect the health of individuals involved in the baker profession.

Issue
Was the New York law regulating bakers’ hours a fair, reasonable and appropriate exercise of the State’s police powers?

Held
No. The lower court is reversed.

Dissent
Justice John Harlan (J. Harlan) said the statute must be regarded as the expression of the citizens of New York that labor in excess of 60 hours a week leads to bad health. Whether or not the statute was wise is not up to the Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) to say. It is impossible to say there is no real relation between the means and ends for this statute.

Discussion
Lochner is one of the most contentious cases in Supreme Court history. The debate centers on the nature of the right to contract. Is the right to contract a fundamental right as J. Peckham tends to believe? If so, from what source does it derive its fundamental character? Can the freedom to contract be said to be fundamental because it is included within the concept of liberty or of property or from some other source?
