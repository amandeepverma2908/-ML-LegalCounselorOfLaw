Brief Fact Summary
A Virginia law mandated the payment of a poll tax, not to exceed $1.50, in order for citizens to be eligible to vote. The constitutionality of the law was brought into question.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A State violates the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution (Constitution) by making the affluence of the voter or the payment of a fee an electoral standard.

Facts
A Virginia law mandated the payment of a poll tax, not to exceed $1.50, in order for citizens to be eligible to vote. The constitutionality of the law was brought into question.

Issue
May a State, consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment, precondition the right to vote in an election on the payment of a poll tax?

Held
No. The judgment of the lower court is reversed.

Dissent
Justice Hugo Black (J. Black) said state poll taxes can reasonably and without invidious purposes, be found to rest on a number of legitimate state interests such as the State’s desire to collect revenue.

Discussion
The Supreme Court of the United States’ (Supreme Court) primary concern in this case was a distinction made as to which citizens were entitled to a fundamental right – the right to vote. One wonders if the Supreme Court was not also concerned about the statute because it involved a “wealth distinction.” Should ones wealth, as ones race or gender, be regarded as a suspect classification?
