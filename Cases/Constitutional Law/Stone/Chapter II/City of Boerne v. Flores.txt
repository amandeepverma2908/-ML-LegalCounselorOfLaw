Brief Fact Summary
A church bishop was denied a building permit by the government and challenged his denial under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (the RFRA). The RFRA required the government to show a compelling state interest any time it substantially burdened religion.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
While preventative laws are sometimes appropriate remedial measures under section five of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United

Facts
Congress enacted the RFRA pursuant to section five of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, under which Congress may pass appropriate legislation in order to “enforce the provisions of this article.” The RFRA provided that no government may substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion even if that burden results from generally applicable legislation, unless the government can demonstrate (1) a compelling state interest and (2) that the least restrictive means was used to further that interest. The statute applied to both federal and state government. A church was denied a building permit by a local zoning authority and challenged the denial under the RFRA., whereupon the authority of Congress to enact RFRA was brought into question.

Issue
Did Congress exceed its powers under section five of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution by enacting RFRA?

Held
Yes. The judgment of the Court of Appeals sustaining the Act’s constitutionality is reversed.

Dissent
Justice Sandra Day O’Connor (J. O’Connor) stated that the Employment Division Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith was wrongly decided and should be overruled.

Discussion
This case truly involves Federalism. The RFRA as applied to the federal government was okay. It is the RFRA as applied to the States that is unconstitutional.
