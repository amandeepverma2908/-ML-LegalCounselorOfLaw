249 U.S. 47, 39 S. Ct. 247, 63 L. Ed. 470, 1919 U.S. 2223.

Brief Fact Summary
Defendants circulated to men who had been conscripted for military service a document containing impassioned ideas against the draft. Defendants were therefore convicted of violating the Espionage Act.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Speech is not constitutionally protected when the words used under the circumstances present a clear and present danger of bringing about the evil Congress has a right to prevent.

Facts
Defendants circulated to men who had been conscripted for military service a document reciting the Thirteenth Amendment (which prohibits involuntary servitude) and saying that the Conscription Act (the “Act”) violated this Amendment. The document went on to list other impassioned ideas, but in form, at least, confined itself to peaceful suggestions such as a petition for the repeal of the Act. Defendants were convicted of conspiring to violate the Espionage Act.

Issue
Was the circular sent by Defendants to draftees protected speech under the First Amendment?

Held
No.

Discussion
It is not abundantly clear what “clear and present” danger the Court is concerned about. Is it a danger of resistance to the draft or something else? The Court here also seems to apply a less protective standard for free speech than Judge Hand in Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten, 244 F. 535 (S.D.N.Y.) 1917) insofar as this Court is willing to allow punishment for speech based on the speaker’s intent more readily than is Judge Hand.
