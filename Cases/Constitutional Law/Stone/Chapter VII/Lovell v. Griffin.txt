303 U.S. 444, 58 S. Ct. 666, 82 L. Ed. 949, 1938 U.S. 297.

Brief Fact Summary
A Griffin, Georgia, law required anyone wishing to distribute literature within city to first obtain permission for doing so. The Appellant, Alma Lovell (Appellant), distributed a religious pamphlet in Griffin without first obtaining a permit and therefore was convicted.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Liberty of the press is a right that permits one to publish materials without obtaining a license.

Facts
A City ordinance of Griffin, Georgia, provided that distributing literature of any kind within the city limits of Griffin, without first permission from the City Manager, shall be deemed a nuisance and punishable as an offense. The Appellant distributed in Griffin, without permission, a pamphlet setting forth the gospel of the “Kingdom of Jehovah” and was therefore convicted.

Issue
Did the Griffin ordinance requiring permission to distribute literature violate the First Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution)?

Held
Yes. The lower court is reversed.

Discussion
This case is really about limiting the discretion of government officials. The statute left it to the judgment of the City Manager, without guidance, to determine what literature would be permissible. It is this type of unguided discretion the Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) finds to be repugnant to the Constitution. It is notable that there was not even a discussion about whether the City Manager had actually abused his discretion. The ordinance was deemed invalid on its face.
