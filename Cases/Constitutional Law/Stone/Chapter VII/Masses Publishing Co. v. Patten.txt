Brief Fact Summary

Synopsis of Rule of Law
If one stops short of urging upon others that it is their duty or in their interest to resist the law, such person shall not be held to have attempted to cause the violation of the law.

Facts
The Postmaster of New York barred the publication of an issue of a revolutionary journal called the Masses on the theory that it caused a mutinous attitude among our troops at a time of war by arousing discontent and disaffection among the people, thus, hampering the government in the conduct of the war in violating the Espionage Act of 1917. The postmaster pointed to four cartoons and four pieces of text as especially violating the Act.

Issue
Was the postmaster of New York’s ban of the allegedly incendiary issue of the journal consistent with the First Amendment’s right of free speech?

Held
No.

Discussion
This case concerns the issue of when the government can ban articles of speech and expression consistent with the First Amendment. The Court concludes that potentially incendiary speech must be permitted unless it proximately or directly leads to civil unrest or a violation of the law.
