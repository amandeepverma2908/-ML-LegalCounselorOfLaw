Brief Fact Summary
In 1952, after the employees of steel companies threatened to strike, the President of the United States Harry Truman (President Truman) ordered the Secretary of Commerce to seize the Nation’s steel companies. The steel companies sued.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The President’s power, if any, to issue an order must stem from an act of Congress or the United States Constitution (Constitution).

Facts
In 1951, a labor dispute arose between the United States steel companies and their employees. In 1952, the employees union gave notice of a nationwide strike. Thereupon, fearful that such a work stoppage would jeopardize our national defense, President Truman issued an order directing the Secretary of Commerce to take possession of the nation’s steel mills. After obeying the orders under protest, the steel companies brought suit in District Court. The District Court issued a temporary restraining order against the government, which the Court of Appeals stayed.

Issue
Did President Truman have the authority to order the seizure of the steel mills?

Held
No. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.

Dissent
Chief Justice Fred Vinson (J. Vinson) argued that we must consider the context in which the President’s powers were exercised – a national exigency. The President’s power to seize the steel mills derives from his duty to executive legislative programs the success of which depends upon the continued production of steel.

Discussion
This case calls into question the extent and the source(s) of the emergency powers of the President, if any, under the Constitution.
