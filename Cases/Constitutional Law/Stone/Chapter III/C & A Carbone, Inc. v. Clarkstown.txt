511 U.S. 383, 114 S. Ct. 1677, 128 L. Ed. 2d 399, 1994 U.S. 3477.

Brief Fact Summary
The Respondent, Clarkstown, New York (Respondent), required all wastes collected within the town to be deposited at a designated private waste station. Whereupon, the station would collect a certain fee. The Petitioner, C & A Carbone, Inc. (Petitioner), wanted to send its Clarkstown wastes collected to an out-of-state station, which charged a lower fee.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Commerce Clause forbids the enactment of local laws that impose commercial barriers or discriminate against an article of commerce by reason of its state origin or destination

Facts
The Respondent subsidized a private waste disposal station by guaranteeing a minimum flow of waste to a private waste station and allowing the station to charge a certain fee. To assure the guaranteed flow, the Town enacted a “flow control ordinance” whereby all solid waste collected from within the town were required to be deposited at the designated station. Petitioner, a private recycling facility, collected waste from elsewhere in New York and in New Jersey. Without the flow control ordinance in effect, Petitioner would have sent its non-recyclable waste to an out-of-state waste station and paid a lower fee for disposal.

Issue
Was the Respondent’s flow control ordinance in violation of the Commerce Clause?

Held
Yes. The judgment of the lower court is reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this decision.

Discussion
Perhaps, the Supreme Court of the United States’ real concern here is with regard to interstate retaliation. The fear is that this type of regulation by New York will trigger similar retaliatory regulations by other states, thereby negatively affecting the national economic market.
