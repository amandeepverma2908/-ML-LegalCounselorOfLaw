Brief Fact Summary
The state of Maryland enacted a statute prohibiting producers or refiners of petroleum products from operating any retail service stations within the state. Some refiners challenged the constitutionality of the statute.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In the absence of a relevant congressional declaration of policy, or a showing of a specific discrimination against, or burdening of, interstate commerce, the States may regulate commerce.

Facts
The state of Maryland enacted a statute prohibiting producers or refiners of petroleum products from operating any retail service stations within the state. The statute was designed for the apparent purpose of correcting irregularities in the distribution and pricing of gasoline. Some refiners, in a challenge to the constitutionality of the statute, introduced evidence to show that their ownership of retail service stations brings significant benefits to the consuming public and that the statute would weaken independent refiners.

Issue
Did the Maryland statute unconstitutionally burden interstate commerce?

Held
No. The judgment of the lower court is affirmed.

Dissent
Justice Harry A. Blackmun stated that discrimination need not appear on the face of a statute to be unconstitutional. Although facially neutral, the effect of the Maryland statute is to protect in-state retail service station dealers from the competition of out-of-state business.
