22 Ill.496 U.S. 1, 110 S. Ct. 2228, 110 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1990)

Brief Fact Summary
The Petitioners, Keller and other members of the State Bar of California (SBC) (Petitioners), sued the Respondent, the SBC (Respondent), on the grounds that the Respondent was using their membership dues to finance activities to which they were opposed.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When membership in an association is compulsory, members may be able to reject how their dues are spent.

Facts
The Respondent is an integrated bar, meaning that membership is compulsory to practice law within the state. The Respondent chose to use membership dues to fund politically charged activities and the Petitioners brought suit alleging that Respondent’s decision to fund those activities was in violation of their First Amendment constitutional rights. The Supreme Court of California rejected Petitioners’ claims on the basis that Respondent is a state agency and can spend funds for any purpose within statutory authority. The Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) granted certiorari.

Issue
The issue here is whether compulsory membership, as a condition to licensure, requires members to adhere to the choices of an association.

Held
Chief Judge William Rehnquist (J. Rehnquist). Reversed.

Discussion
An important note in this case is the compulsory nature of the membership in the association. If the members chose to associate themselves, based on political beliefs, they could not later oppose expenditures or, alternatively, they could disassociate themselves with the association.
