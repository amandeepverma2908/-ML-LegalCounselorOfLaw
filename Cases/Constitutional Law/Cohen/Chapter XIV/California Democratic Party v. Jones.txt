22 Ill.530 U.S. 567, 120 S. Ct. 2402, 147 L. Ed. 2d 502 (2000)

Brief Fact Summary
The Petitioners, the California Democratic Party, the California Republican Party, the Libertarian Party of California and the Peace and Freedom Party (Petitioners), brought suit alleging that California’s change to a blanket primary election violated their First Amendment freedoms of association.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Political parties cannot be compelled to open their primaries to members of other parties.

Facts
In 1996, California changed to a blanket primary system, wherein all persons entitled to vote could vote for any candidate, regardless of their political affiliation. The Petitioners brought suit, alleging the primaries would be diluted and that their associations would have less impact on the determination of political candidates. The District Court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed that the burden on the rights of association were not severe. The Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) granted certiorari.

Issue
This case considers whether the rights of a political association to exclude are protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution, under their freedom of association.

Held
Reversed.

Dissent
Judge John Paul Stevens (J. Stevens) dissented, arguing that a State’s power to determine how elections are to be run is an attribute of its sovereignty, which should not be overlooked.

Discussion
In this case, the Court creates a negative right of association, or the right “not to associate”.
