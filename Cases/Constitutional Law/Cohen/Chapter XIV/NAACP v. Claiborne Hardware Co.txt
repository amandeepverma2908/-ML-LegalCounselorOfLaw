Facts
Beginning in 1966, under the direction of the Petitioner, black citizens began to boycott the businesses of several white merchants, on the basis of racial injustice. The Respondents brought suit asking for damages, alleging that their businesses had suffered due to the boycott. In 1976, ten years after the beginning of the boycott, the Trial Court held for the Respondents and awarded damages for lost business, in excess of $1.25 million. The Supreme Court of the State of Mississippi upheld the imposition of liability under the theory of malicious interference, and the Petitioner appealed to the United States Supreme Court (Supreme Court).

Issue
This case considers whether demonstrators in a boycott, who are exercising their right to freely associate, can be held liable for damages caused to a business as a result of the boycott.

Held
Reversed.

Discussion
Included in the right to freely associate is the right to demonstrate and align oneâ€™s self with the ideals of the association.
