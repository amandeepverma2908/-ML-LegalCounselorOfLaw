22 Ill.413 U.S. 548, 93 S. Ct. 2880, 37 L. Ed. 2d 796 (1973)

Brief Fact Summary
Six individual federal employees and local political committees filed a complaint asserting that the Hatch Act (codified as 5 U.S.C. Section:7324(a)(2)) (the Act) was facially unconstitutional insofar as it prevented federal employees from taking an active part in political management or campaigns.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
This case illustrates the rule that Congress may impose restrictions on federal employees, as long as the restrictions are uniform.

Facts
Six individual federal employees and local political committees filed a complaint asserting that the Hatch Act (codified as 5 U.S.C. Section:7324(a)(2)) (the Act) was facially unconstitutional insofar as it prevented federal employees from taking an active part in political management or campaigns. The District Court for the District of Columbia held that the Act was facially unconstitutional in that it prevented freedom of expression. The Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) granted certiorari.

Issue
The issue presented in this case is whether a Federal statute prohibiting federal employees from taking an active part in the election process is constitutional.

Held
Reversed.

Discussion
Because the restrictions outlined in the Act apply to all federal employees, no particular employeeâ€™s viewpoint is being discriminated against. In this case, uniform suppression of an activity serves the greater good of governmental effectiveness.
