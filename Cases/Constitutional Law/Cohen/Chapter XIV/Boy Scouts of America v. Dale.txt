Brief Fact Summary
The Respondent, Dale (Respondent), was an eagle scout whose membership in the boy scouts was revoked when the Petitioners, the Boy Scouts of America (Petitioner), learned that he was a homosexual.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
While individuals are given a right to freely associate, associations are not forced to include members whose beliefs may affect its own ability to express the message it wishes to convey.

Facts
The Respondent, a life-long boy scout, was an assistant scout master in New Jersey, when the Petitioner learned of his homosexuality and revoked his membership. The Respondent brought suit to enjoin the action and the New Jersey court, under its public accommodations law, required the Petitioner to admit the Respondent.

Issue
This case questions whether an organization can be compelled to accept a member whose activities and beliefs may be against the very nature of the organization.

Held
Reversed.

Dissent
Justice John Paul Stevens (J. Stevens) dissented, noting that by allowing the Petitioner to revoke the Respondentâ€™s membership, the Supreme Court was allowing the organization to prevail over the anti-discrimination laws of the state.

Discussion
An organization cannot be compelled to accept a member whose beliefs do not align with the tenants upon, which the organization stands. To do so would violate the First Amendment constitutional rights of the entire organization and its members, who also align themselves with the principals on which the organization stands.
