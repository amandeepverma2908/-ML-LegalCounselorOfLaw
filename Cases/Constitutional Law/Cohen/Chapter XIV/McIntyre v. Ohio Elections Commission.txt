Brief Fact Summary

Anonymous political speech is still to be protected under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution).

Facts
Mrs. McIntyre distributed anonymous political information at several public meetings, expressing her opposition to a proposed tax levy.

The Court of Appeals reinstated the fine, and the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed. The Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) granted certiorari

Issue
This case considers whether the freedom to publish anonymously extends to political speech.

Held
Reversed.

Dissent
Justice Antonin Scalia (J. Scalia) dissented, arguing that anonymous electioneering was not necessarily a constitutional right.

Discussion
The freedom to express oneâ€™s political viewpoint without fear of repercussions is a principal upon which the First Amendment on was founded. Anonymity allows a political speaker to exercise this freedom.
