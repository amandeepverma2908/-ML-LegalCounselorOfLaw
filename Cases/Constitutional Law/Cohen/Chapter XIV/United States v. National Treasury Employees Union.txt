Brief Fact Summary
The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 (the Act) enacted an honoraria ban, a broad prohibition against allowing federal employees from accepting any compensation for making speeches or writing articles, regardless of whether the speeches or articles have any connection to that person’s official duties.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The fact of federal employment, alone, is not enough to allow a broad prohibition, disallowing federal employees compensation for their own expressive works.

Facts
The Act enacted an honoraria ban, a broad prohibition against allowing federal employees from accepting any compensation for making speeches or writing articles, regardless of whether the speeches or articles have any connection to that person’s official duties. The Respondents herein filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the honoraria ban. The District Court granted summary judgment in their favor and the Court of Appeals affirmed. The Supreme Court granted certiorari.

Issue
This case presents the issue of whether federal employees can seek compensation for their expressive activities as citizens.

Held
Affirmed.

Dissent
Chief Judge Rehnquist (J. Rehnquist) dissents, arguing that the Court ignores the Governmental interest in prevention of impropriety.

Discussion
In considering whether federal employment bars an employee the right to receive compensation for his expressive endeavors, one must consider the type of endeavor and whether it affects the governmental interest in preventing improper compensation.
