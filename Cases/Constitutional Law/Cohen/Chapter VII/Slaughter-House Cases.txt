Brief Fact Summary
Butchers had to use one facility to slaughter their livestock. All competing plants were closed and the butchers had to right to slaughter at the corporation’s plant.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments do not protect people from state legislation.

Facts
Louisiana chartered a corporation and granted to it by statute the exclusive right to operate facilities in New Orleans for the landing, keeping and slaughter of livestock. All other facilities were closed and the independent butchers were given the right to slaughter at the corporation’s plant on paying maximum charges that were fixed by statute. The butchers claimed that the statute created a monopoly and denied butchers the right to exercise their trade.

Issue
Do the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments apply to the states?

Held
Justice Miller’s opinion. No.

Dissent
Justice Field dissenting.

Discussion
The Court held that the fundamental rights set forth in the Bill of Rights were not privileges and immunities of national citizenship. Therefore, the Fourteenth Amendment privileges and immunities clause is ineffective in protecting individual rights.
