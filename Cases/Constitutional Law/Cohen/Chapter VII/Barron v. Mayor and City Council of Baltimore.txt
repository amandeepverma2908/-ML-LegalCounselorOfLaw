Brief Fact Summary
Barron (Plaintiff) claimed that municipal street construction diverted the flow of streams so that they deposited silt in front of his wharf making the water so shallow that vessels could not reach the wharf.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Bill of Rights, including the Fifth Amendment takings clause, was intended to apply only to federal courts, not to state courts.

Facts
Plaintiff sued for the property damage done by the municipal street construction on his wharf, and received a $45,000.00 verdict by the county court. The circuit court reversed. Plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. Plaintiff contended that the state court had failed to grant his property the protection guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution which prohibits taking property for public use without just compensation.

Issue
Does the Fifth Amendment apply to the legislative power of a state as well as that of the United States.

Held
Justice Marshall opinion. No.

Discussion
The Bill of Rights (Amendments 1-10) adopted in 1791 imposed a substantial series of protections for the individuals against government. Almost 80 years later the Civil War Amendments (13, 14, and 15) specifically imposed retrains on the power of states to regulate the personal and property interests of their citizens.
