Brief Fact Summary
In protest of the Vietnam War, several students wore black armbands to school.

The Petitioners, Tinker and other students (Petitioners) refused to remove their armbands and brought suit seeking protection of their First Amendment constitutional rights to political expression.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
This case presents the landmark decision that a student does not shed his personal rights at the schoolhouse door.

Facts
In protest of the Vietnam War, several students wore black armbands to school. The Respondent adopted a policy that any students wearing the bands would be suspended for causing disruption. The Petitioners refused to remove their armbands and brought suit seeking protection of their First Amendment constitutional rights to political expression. After the Respondent invoked its policy, the Petitioners refused to remove their armbands and were suspended. They brought suit in federal court, seeking an injunction from the disciplinary practice, maintaining that they had done nothing disruptive. The District Court and Court of Appeals upheld the school action and an appeal was brought to the Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court).

Issue
This case considers what happens when the fundamental rights of students collide with school policies, which are facially designed to lessen controversy.

Held
Justice Abe Fortas (J. Fortas). Reversed and Remanded.

Dissent
Justice Hugo Black (J. Black).

Discussion
This case stands for the proposition that the First Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution), as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment, will allow passive expression of opinion, even as to controversial topics.
