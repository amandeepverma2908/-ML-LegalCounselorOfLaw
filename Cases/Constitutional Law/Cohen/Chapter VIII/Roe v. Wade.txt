Brief Fact Summary
A single pregnant woman challenged a Texas law prohibiting her from having an abortion.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The right to privacy encompasses a woman’s right to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy by abortion.

Facts
A Texas statute criminalized abortions except for situations when abortion was necessary to save the life of the mother. The Appellant, Roe (Appellant), challenged the Texas statute. The Appellant argued that the statute violated her fundamental right to privacy. The District Court held that the Appellee failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that the Texas statute’s “infringement upon Roe’s rights was necessary to support a compelling state interest, and that, although the defendant presented ’several compelling justifications for state presence in the area of abortions,’ the statutes outstripped these justifications and swept ‘far beyond any areas of compelling state interest.’”

Issue
Whether the fundamental right to privacy includes a woman’s right to decide whether to have an abortion.

Held
Justice Harry Blackmun (J. Blackmun). Yes. The fundamental right to privacy includes a woman’s right to decide whether to have an abortion. “The statute makes no distinction between abortions performed early in pregnancy and those performed later, and it limits to a single reason, “saving” the mother’s life, the legal justification for the procedure. The statute, therefore, cannot survive the constitutional attack made upon it here.”

Dissent
The dissenting opinions are as follows:

Discussion
This case extends the constitutional right to privacy to abortion cases.
