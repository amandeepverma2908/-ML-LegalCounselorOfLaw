22 Ill.372 U.S. 726, 83 S. Ct. 1028, 10 L. Ed. 2d 93 (1963)

Brief Fact Summary
A Kansas statute made it a misdemeanor for any person to engage in the business of debt adjusting. It was challenged as a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Court completely abandoned scrutiny and would not look at the wisdom of legislation. The Kansas Legislature was free to decide for itself that legislation was needed to deal with the business of debt adjusting. Any arguments in favor of debt adjusting are properly addressed to the legislature, not to the courts.

Facts
A three-judge district court panel ruled that the Kansas statute making it a misdemeanor for any person to engage in the business of debt adjusting except as incident to the lawful practice of law in this state was a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Debt adjusting was defined as making a contract with a debtor when he pays a certain amount of money to the person engaged in the adjusting and then that person distributes the money to creditors in accordance with a plan.

Issue
Did the Kansas statute outlawing a person from engaging in debt adjusting violate the Due Process Clause?

Held
Justice Black opinion.

Discussion
Has the Court overcompensated from Lochner and gone too far in the other direction?
