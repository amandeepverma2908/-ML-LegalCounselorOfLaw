Brief Fact Summary
A New York labor law required employees to work no more than sixty hours in one week.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The 1897 Labor Law limiting the hours that an employee in a biscuit, bread, or cake bakery or confectionery establishment may work is an abridgement to their liberty of contract and a violation of due process.

Facts
The 1897 Labor Law stated that no employee can be required or permitted to work in a biscuit, bread, or cake bakery or confectionery establishment more than sixty hours in a week or more than ten hours in one day, unless to make work on the last day of the week shorter. And the number of hours worked in a week could not average out to be more than ten hours per day.

Issue
Does the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment protect liberty of contract and private property against unwarranted government interference?

Held
Justice Peckham opinion. This law is an abridgment to the liberty of contract and a violation of due process.

Dissent
Justices Holmes, Harlan, White and Day dissenting.

Discussion
In 1917, without mentioning its opinion in Lochner, the Court upheld a law, which provided for a maximum ten-hour day for factory workers of both genders and regulated overtime pay. Bunting v. Oregon.
