Brief Fact Summary
Nebbia, owner of a grocery store, was convicted for selling milk at a price below the minimum fixed by a New York statute.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Business regulations are upheld when the legislative objective is to protect public health and safety rather than to interfere with the free market. The regulations must be sufficiently related to the legislative objectives.

Facts
A New York statute provided for the fixing of maximum and minimum prices for the sale of milk. The legislature, after extensive hearings had determined that economic conditions and destructive trade practices jeopardized an adequate milk supply at reasonable prices to consumers and producers and that price controls would help. Nebbia sold milk at his store below the minimum price fixed. He contended that the statute deprived him of due process of law.

Issue
Does the statute deprive Nebbia of due process of law?

Held
Justice Robertsâ€™ opinion. No, the Fourteenth Amendment cannot be invoked to resist necessary and appropriate exertion of the police power.

Discussion
Business regulations are upheld when the legislative objective is to protect public health and safety rather than to interfere with the free market. The regulations must be sufficiently related to the legislative objectives.
