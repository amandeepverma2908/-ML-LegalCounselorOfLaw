22 Ill.304 U.S. 144, 58 S. Ct. 778, 82 L. Ed. 1234 (1938)

Brief Fact Summary
Congress passed a law, which prohibited shipping milk containing any fat or oil other than milk fat in interstate commerce.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Court upheld a federal prohibition on the interstate shipment of filled milk, because it is a decision that should be made by Congress, not by courts.

Facts
This was an indictment for shipping in interstate commerce packages of “milnut” a compound of condensed skimmed milk and coconut oil made in imitation or semblance of condensed milk or cream. The “Filled Milk Act” of Congress prohibited the shipment in interstate commerce of skimmed milk compounded with any fat or oil other than milk fat so as to resemble milk or cream.

Issue
Does the act, which prohibits the shipment in interstate commerce of filled milk infringe the Fifth Amendment?

Held
Justice Stone opinion.

Discussion
Thirty-four years later, the successor company to Carolene Products Company successfully attacked the constitutionality of this Act as applied on the ground that the facts, which justified the decision at the time, ceased to exist. The Court agreed and the act was struck down as a violation of due process. That act had no rational means for the achievement of the announced objectives.
