Brief Fact Summary
New Jersey prohibited the importation of most solid or liquid waste, which originated or was collected outside the State. Private landfill operators in New Jersey and several cities in other states that had agreements with New Jersey operators filed suit.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Although burdens on interstate commerce may be unavoidable when a State legislates to safeguard the health and safety of its people, the court is still alert to the economic isolation and protectionism. A statute can be deemed invalid not solely because the legislature was trying to isolate the state or area, but also because the statute actually isolates the state or area even though legislators did not so intend.

Facts
A New Jersey law prohibited the importation of most solid or liquid waste which originated or was collected outside the territorial limits of the State. Private landfill operators in New Jersey and several cities in other states that had agreements with these operators brought suit against New Jersey in state court challenging the validity of the statute and regulations issued under it. The New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the legislation. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.

Issue
Does the statutory prohibition on imported solid or liquid waste violate the Commerce Clause because it is a protectionist measure?

Held
Justice Stewart opinion: Yes. New Jersey Supreme Court judgment reversed.

Dissent
Justice Rehnquist and the Chief Justice dissent.

Discussion
The majority found a per se violation of the Commerce Clause because New Jersey was impeding commerce. They did not find the environmental justifications strong enough to override the Commerce Clause concerns.
