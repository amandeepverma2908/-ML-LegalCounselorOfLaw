22 Ill.240 F. Supp. 270 (E.D. Va. 1964)

Brief Fact Summary
Voters challenge the constitutionality of a poll tax.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Prerequisite payments within the election process are unconstitutional.

Facts
Voters challenged the constitutionality of Virginia’s poll tax. The right to vote was conditioned on the payment of a poll tax. The District Court dismissed the case because it relied on Breedlove v. Suttles, which upheld a “[l]evy ‘by the poll’” as a prerequisite to voting. The judgment is reversed.

Issue
Whether requiring payment of a poll tax before one can vote is constitutional.

Held
Justice William Douglas (J. Douglas). No. “[A] State violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment whenever it makes the affluence of the voter or payment of any fee an electoral standard.” “[W]ealth or fee paying has, in our view, no relation to voting qualifications; the right to vote is too precious, too fundamental to be so burdened or conditioned.” The judgment is reversed.

Dissent
The dissenting opinions are as follows:

Discussion
This case overrules the decision of Breedlove v. Suttles, which upheld an older form of taxation that was used as a prerequisite for voting.
