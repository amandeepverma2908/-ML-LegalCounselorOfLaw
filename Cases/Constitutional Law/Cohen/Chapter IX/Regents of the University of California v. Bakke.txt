Brief Fact Summary
A white student was denied admission into medical school despite having scores higher than minority student admitted into the school under a special quota system.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Race-based classifications, for purposes of school admissions, are constitutional. The use of racial-quotas, however, is unconstitutional.

Facts
The Respondent, Alan Bakke (Respondent), a white male, applied to, and was rejected, by the Davis Medical School in 1973 and 1974. The schoolâ€™s admission program allowed for sixteen out of 100 slots to be reserved for the admission of minority students. The Respondent argued that his grade point average and MCAT scores were higher than minorities who where granted admissions, within the sixteen slots, into the school. The California Supreme Court ruled in favor of his equal protection claim declaring that the admissions program was unlawful and enjoined the School from considering the race of an applicant. The judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part.

Discussion
In order to mend the harmful effects of race discrimination, racial minorities who have been historically discriminated against need to be treated differently in order to be treated equally under the requirements of the Constitution.
