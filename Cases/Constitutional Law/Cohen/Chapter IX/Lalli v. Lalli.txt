22 Ill.439 U.S. 259, 99 S. Ct. 518, 58 L. Ed. 2d 503 (1978)

Brief Fact Summary
The Appellant, Robert Lalli (Appellant), seeking inheritance from his father, challenges the constitutionality of a New York statute requiring him to prove paternity, before the death of his father.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
State laws classifying children on legitimacy must be substantially related to the important state interest the statute is intended to promote.

Facts
The Appellant claimed to be the illegitimate son of Mario Lalli who died intestate. The Appellant argued that he was entitled to inherit from father and that the New York statute, requiring him to obtain an order of filiation during his father’s lifetime, discriminated against him on the basis of his illegitimate birth in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution). A New York trial and appellate court ruled against the Appellant. The judgment of the appellate court is affirmed.

Issue
Whether the New York law requiring illegitimate children to provide a particular form of proof of paternity, in order to inherit from their fathers, is unconstitutional.

Held
No. The New York requirement for illegitimate children who would inherit from their fathers is substantially related to the important state interests that the statute intended to promote. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

Dissent
Justice William Brennan (J. Brennan). The New York statute discriminates against illegitimate children “through means not substantially related to the legitimate interests that the state purports to promote . . . .”

Discussion
The Supreme Court illustrated that paternity suits are now classified among gender discrimination cases and require intermediate scrutiny requiring that the statutory classification be substantially related to an important governmental objective.
