Brief Fact Summary
California’s statutory rape law holds only males, not females, criminally liable for having sexual intercourse with females under the age of 18.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A statute’s gender-based classification is constitutionally permissible if the classification bears a substantial relationship to an important governmental interest.

Facts
The Petitioner, Michael M. (Petitioner), a seventeen and a half year-old male, sought to have California’s statutory rape law declared unconstitutional, on state and federal grounds, because the law defines statutory rape as “an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a female not the wife of the perpetrator, where the female is under the age of 18 years,” and thus, unlawfully discriminates on the basis of gender. The California trial and appellate courts denied the Petitioner’s request for relief. The Supreme Court of California upheld the judgments of the lower courts. The ruling of the Supreme Court of California was affirmed.

Issue
Whether California’s “statutory rape” law violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution) because it only holds males criminally liable for sexual intercourse as defined under the statute.

Held
(J. Rehnquist) No. The California’s statutory rape law bears a substantial relationship to important governmental objectives, and thus, the statute passes constitutional muster. The judgment of the California Supreme Court is affirmed.

Dissent
The dissenting opinions are as follows:

Discussion
When men and women are situated differently, a statute creating gender-based classifications can withstand a constitutional challenge if the purpose of the statute can pass the intermediate level of scrutiny.
