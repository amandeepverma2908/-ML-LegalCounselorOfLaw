Brief Fact Summary
A New Jersey reapportionment plan destroyed population equality

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Apportionment schemes that result in inequity among populations violates Article I, Section 2 of the United States Constitution (Constitution).

Facts
The New Jersey Legislature adopted the Feldman Plan containing 14 districts. The New Jersey Legislature created a reapportionment scheme, which resulted in a one percent population difference between the largest and the smallest districts. A group of individuals challenged the legislation arguing that it violated Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution. The District Court declared the reapportionment scheme unconstitutional.

Issue
Whether an apportionment plan for congressional districts satisfies the Constitution if the population for the largest district is less than one percent greater than the population of the smallest district.

Held
(J. Brennan). Yes. “Article I, Section 2 establishes a ‘high standard of justice and common sense’ for the apportionment of congressional districts: ‘equal representation for equal numbers of people.’” “Given that the census-based population deviations in the Feldman Plan reflect real differences among the districts, it is clear that they could have been avoided or significantly reduced with a good-faith effort to achieve population equality. For that reason alone, it would be inappropriate to accept the Feldman Plan as “functionally equivalent” to a plan with districts of equal population. The judgment is affirmed.

Dissent
The dissenting opinions are as follows:

Discussion
This case supports the notion that each vote in a congressional election must be equally weighted.
