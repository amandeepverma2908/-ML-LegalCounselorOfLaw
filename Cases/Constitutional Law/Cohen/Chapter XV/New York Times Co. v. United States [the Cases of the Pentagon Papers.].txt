22 Ill.403 U.S. 713, 91 S. Ct. 2140, 29 L. Ed. 2d 822, 1 Med. L. Rptr. 1031 (1971)

Brief Fact Summary
The Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) granted certiorari, to consider the whether the United States could enjoin both the New York Times and the Washington Post from printing the Pentagon Papers.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The First Amendment freedom of the press should be afforded the greatest protection. An injunction that seeks to proactively quash speech is impermissible, unless imminent harm can be proven.

Facts
The Petitioners, the New York Times and The Washington Post (Petitioners), sought to print the Pentagon Papers in their newspapers. Arguing that insurrection may arise from the publishing, the Respondent, the United States government (Respondent), sought to enjoin the publication of the Papers. The District Courts for New York and the District of Columbia, along with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals all held that the government did not meet the burden of showing justification for the imposition of an injunction.

Issue
The facial issue is whether the government, under the guise of national security, can seek to regulate the activities of the press.

Held
In a pure plurality, the Supreme Court held that the government could not justify a proactive injunction, under the impermissible doctrine of prior restraint.

Dissent
Justice John Harlan (J. Harlan) dissented, agreeing that it is a judiciary function to protect the First Amendment freedom of the press, but disagreeing that the government had not met its burden of proving the injunction was necessary.

Discussion
This case strikes at the heart of freedom of the press, as it is outlined in the First Amendment of the Constitution. Any prior restraint of information is necessarily an abrogation of the constitutionally protected rights of the press.
