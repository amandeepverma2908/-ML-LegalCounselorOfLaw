22 Ill.448 U.S. 555, 100 S. Ct. 2814, 65 L. Ed. 2d 973, 6 Med. L. Rptr. 1833 (1980)

Brief Fact Summary
Two newsmen, who were closed out of a criminal trial, brought suit seeking a declaration of their rights to attend the trial under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution).

Synopsis of Rule of Law
This case created a brightline rule, that without proper justification, a reporter cannot be kept out of a criminal trial.

Facts
During the course of a trial, which had ended in three previous mistrials, counsel for the defendant asked that the proceedings be closed to the public, which excluded the presence of the press.

Issue
This case considered whether the freedom of the press necessarily carries with it a right to attend criminal trials and a right of access to the trial itself, in pursuit of information.

Held
The Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) held that a right to attend a criminal trial was implicit in the guarantees of the First Amendment of the Constitution.

Dissent
Judge William Rehnquist (J. Rehnquist) dissented, maintaining that where both a prosecutor and defense counsel agree to the closure of a trial, their wishes should be heeded in the interest of their clients.

Discussion
The crux of the principals outlined in this case is that the First Amendment of the Constitution guarantees a right of access to the government and as the court is an extension thereof, the press (and members of the public) should not be excluded from the judicial process.
