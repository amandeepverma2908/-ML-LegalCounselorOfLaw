22 Ill.520 U.S. 180, 117 S. Ct. 1174, 137 L. Ed. 2d 369, 25 Med. L. Rptr. 1449, 6 CR 829 (1997)

Brief Fact Summary
The Petitioners, Turner Broadcasting System and a host of other cable companies (Petitioners), brought suit seeking to have the portion of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (the Act) dealing with the must-carry provisions applicable to local television stations, declared unconstitutional as an abrogation of their First Amendment constitutional rights.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The rule enunciated by this case is that broadcasters are to be afforded First Amendment rights in freedom of speech, but they cannot abrogate the rights of other broadcasters, or force them out of the market.

Facts
The Act included provisions that required cable companies to carry local television stations. These “must-carry” provisions were controversial, in that Petitioners argued they were an abrogation of their First Amendment rights, not to subscribe to other viewpoints. The District Court granted summary judgment for the Respondent, the FCC (Respondent), noting that the governmental interest in including the “must-carry” outweighed the infringement on Petitioners’ speech. The Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) granted certiorari.

Issue
The issue at hand is whether cable companies can be compelled to carry other stations, in violation of their First Amendment constitutional rights.

Held
Affirmed.

Dissent
Justice Sandra Day O’Connor (J. O’Connor) dissented, maintaining that “must-carry” provisions were actually a guise for content regulation, in the inclusion of local programming.

Discussion
While a broadcast company is to be afforded all First Amendment protections, it cannot invoke those protections in abrogating the rights of other broadcaste
