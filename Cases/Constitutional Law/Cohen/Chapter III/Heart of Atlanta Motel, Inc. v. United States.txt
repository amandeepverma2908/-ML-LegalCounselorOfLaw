Brief Fact Summary
The owners of a motel refused to rent rooms to Negroes and wanted to continue to do so. The motel was situated between many interstates in Atlanta and 75% of its patronage was from out-of-town.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
If a business activity deals with or affects interstate commerce, it is subject to the reach of the Commerce Clause.

Facts
A motel was situated in downtown Atlanta, close to many interstates. The motel also took out billboards and advertised nationally. The owners of the motel refused to serve Negroes, and challenged the constitutionality of Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Issue
Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 constitutional?

Held
The motel could not refuse service to Negroes because Title II was not unconstitutional. Discrimination against Negroes keeps them from traveling in the country. Such discrimination may adversely affect commerce, thereby invoking the Commerce Clause. The motel was therefore subject to Congress’ power to regulate its actions by passing laws such as the Civil Rights Act.

Discussion
The test of Congress’ power to regulate commerce is whether the activity at issue concerns more than one state and substantially affects national commerce.
