22 Ill.482 U.S. 578, 107 S. Ct. 2573, 96 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1987)

Brief Fact Summary
This case arose from a parental challenge to the Creation Act (the Act), which called for the teaching of “creation science” alongside evolution in Louisiana schools.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
“Creation Science”, as an alternative to the theory of evolution has religious undertones and the teaching of its doctrine violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution).

Facts
The Respondents, brought suit challenging the constitutionality of the Act in District Court, on the grounds that the Act’s mandate that “Creation Science” be taught alongside the theory of Evolution was facially unconstitutional. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Respondents, which was affirmed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

Issue
The issue in this case is whether the Act is facially invalid as a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution.

Held
Affirmed.

Dissent
Justice Antonin Scalia (J. Scalia) dissented, noting that he would remand for further consideration as to what “Creation Science” is, because a question of material fact exists.

Discussion
When dealing with the Establishment Clause, it is important to understand that there is little room for interpretation. If a statute facially requires respect of any religious institution, it will not be upheld against constitutional scrutiny.
