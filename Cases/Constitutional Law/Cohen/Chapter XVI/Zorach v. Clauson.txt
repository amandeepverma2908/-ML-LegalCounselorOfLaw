22 Ill.343 U.S. 306, 72 S. Ct. 679, 96 L. Ed. 954 (1952)

Brief Fact Summary
The Petitioners, Zorach and other taxpayers and residents of New York City (Petitioners), brought suit challenging the constitutionality of a “released time” program, which allowed children to leave school, with parental permission, for religious instruction.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
This case stands for the proposition that the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution (Constitution) does not advocate hostility toward religion and mere acknowledgment of a religious program, without participation, is not unconstitutional.

Facts
The “released time” program allowed children, with parental permission, to be released from school for religious instruction. The instructions took place away from the school grounds and no school involvement was required, other than acknowledging the students’ participation. The Petitioners brought suit challenging the constitutionality of the program alleging that the prohibition against any laws respecting the establishment of any religion also prohibited this voluntary program. The Petitioners appealed from a judgment for the Respondents, Clauson and other member of the Board of Education of the City of New York (Respondents) and the Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) granted writs.

Issue
The issue is simply whether New York, through its acceptance of the “released time” program, has engaged in the respect of an establishment of religion, within the meaning of the First Amendment of the Constitution.

Held
Affirmed.

Dissent
Justices Hugo Black (J. Black) and Robert Jackson (J. Jackson) wrote separate dissents, both standing for the proposition that the majority had blurred the line between the separation of church and state.

Discussion
While the establishment clause prohibits governmental support of religion, it does not prohibit students from exercising their religions.
