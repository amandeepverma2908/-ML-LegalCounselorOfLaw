22 Ill.330 U.S. 1, 67 S. Ct. 504, 91 L. Ed. 711 (1947)

Brief Fact Summary
The Petitioner, Everson (Petitioner), in his status as a taxpayer, filed suit challenging the ability of the Respondent, Board of Education (Respondent), to reimburse funds to parents of parochial school students for the transportation of their children to and from school.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
This case stands for the proposition that, while no law respecting an establishment of religion will stand under the United States Constitution (Constitution), neutral laws, which afford benefits to children will be upheld.

Facts
The Petitioner in his status as a taxpayer filed suit challenging the ability of the Respondent to reimburse funds to parents of parochial school students for the transportation of their children to and from school. The Petitioner brought suit alleging that the New Jersey reimbursement statute respects the establishment of religion, by allowing the parents of parochial school students to benefit from the reimbursement scheme. The New Jersey Court of Appeals held that the statute did not violate the Constitution and the Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) granted certiorari to consider the issue.

Issue
This case considers whether the parents of parochial school children can benefit from the same services afforded to the parents of public school children.

Held
Affirmed.

Dissent
The dissents of Justice Robert Jackson (J. Jackson) and Justice Wiley Rutledge (J. Rutledge) stand for strict adherence to the establishment clause.

Discussion
It is important to understand, in striking down the Establishment Clause challenge, the Supreme Court highlights the fact that funds cannot be commingled when they are reimbursed only for transportation costs already expended. Thus, because there is no possibility of funding parochial activities in themselves, the statute is allowed to stand.
