22 Ill.426 U.S. 736, 96 S. Ct. 2337, 49 L. Ed. 2d 179 (1976)

Brief Fact Summary
The Appellants, Roemer and three other Maryland taxpayers (Appellants), brought suit seeking a declaration of a State statute’s invalidity under the Establishment Clause because it seeks to grant funds to private colleges, some of which are religiously affiliated.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
This case follows in the line of Agostini and Mitchell. The Establishment Clause will not invalidate a statute, which seeks to allocate funds to religious educational institutions, provided there is no evidence of misuse of the funds.

Facts
The Appellants and three other Maryland taxpayers brought suit seeking a declaration of a State statute’s invalidity under the Establishment Clause because it seeks to grant funds to private colleges, some of which are religiously affiliated. The District Court refused Petitioners’ injunction and appeal was taken directly to the Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court), which granted certiorari.

Issue
This case considers whether funds, ear-marked as grants for institutions of higher education, must necessarily be withheld from institutions that are religiously affiliated.

Held
Affirmed.

Dissent
Justice William Brennan (J. Brennan) dissented because the funds were not ear- marked at payment and he felt the interests of government and religion could easily become blurred in such a situation. Conversely, Justice John Paul Stevens (J. Stevens) dissented because the funds could also serve as a deterrent on the goals of the religious institution.

Discussion
This case again stands for the proposition that funds should not be withheld from an educational institution when it is religiously-affiliated, unless it can be proven that the funds would be used for religious purposes.
