Brief Fact Summary
President Nixon wanted to quash a subpoena directing him to produce certain tape recordings and documents relating to his conversations with aids and advisers.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Presidential privilege is valid only to protect military, diplomatic or sensitive national security secrets.

Facts
President Nixon was named as a co-conspirator to defraud the United States and to obstruct justice. A subpoena was issued to the President by the United States District Court and it required the production in advance of trial of certain tapes, memoranda, papers, transcripts or other writings relating to certain precisely identified meetings between the President and others.

Issue
Could the President claim absolute executive privilege for documents relating to conversations having to do with a criminal matter?

Held
Chief Justice Burger opinion. No. The President holds a qualified privilege.

Discussion
Granting the President powers to keep evidence of the bribes out of court would upset the separation of powers doctrine and gravely impair the role of the courts under Article III.
