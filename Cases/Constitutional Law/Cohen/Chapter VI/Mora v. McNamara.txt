22 Ill.389 U.S. 934, 88 S. Ct. 282, 19 L. Ed. 2d 287 (1967)

Brief Fact Summary
Three people were drafted into the United States Army in late 1965. They brought suit to prevent the Army from requiring them to serve in Vietnam.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Supreme Court of the United States will give great deference to Congress and the President when dealing with war issues.

Facts
The petitioners were drafted into the United States Army in late 1965 and were to be shipped to Vietnam six months later. They brought suit to prevent the Army from carrying out those orders and requested a declaratory judgment that the present United States military activity in Vietnam is “illegal”. The district court dismissed the suit and the court of appeals affirmed. The write of certiorari to the Supreme Court was denied.

Issue
Should the writ of certiorari be denied?

Held
Yes.

Dissent
Justice Stewart and Justice Douglas dissenting.

Discussion
In the Prize cases, Justice Grier emphasized the arguments for strong presidential powers in the majority opinion. Justice Nelson writing for the minority interpreted the Constitution more strictly, emphasizing that what is war in actuality may not constitute war in the constitutional sense. This has been a recurrent theme throughout history with the Spanish-American War, the Boxer Rebellion, Two World Wars, Korea and then Vietnam. Whether or not Vietnam was an “unconstitutional” war was never decided. The lower courts generally ruled that the issue was nonjusticiable.
