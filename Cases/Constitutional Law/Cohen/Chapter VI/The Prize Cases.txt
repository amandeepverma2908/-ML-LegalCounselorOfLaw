Brief Fact Summary
Union ships pursuant to President Lincoln’s April 1861 Order declared a blockade of southern ports seized ships carrying goods to the Confederate States.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
It is the Congressional prerogative “to declare war” under Article , Section: 8, Clause 11. However, the President has the ability to take action when attacked.

Facts
In April 1861 President Lincoln declared a blockade of southern ports. Pursuant to this blockade in May and July 1861, Union ships seized Confederate merchant vessels and cargoes of foreign neutrals and residents of the southern states. The ships were condemned by federal court order. The owners of the ships and cargo appealed.

Issue
Did President Lincoln have the authority to institute a blockade of southern ports?

Held
Justice Grier. Yes.

Dissent
Justices Nelson, Catron, Clifford and Chief Justice Taney dissenting.

Discussion
The majority opinion held that the President could resist an attack by a foreign nation. The fact that the attack in this case came from an internal part of the Union rather than from a foreign power does not eliminate the President’s power to take action.
