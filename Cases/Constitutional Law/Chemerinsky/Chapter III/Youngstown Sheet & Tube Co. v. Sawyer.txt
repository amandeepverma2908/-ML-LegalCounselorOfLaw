Brief Fact Summary
Steel workers threatened to strike and shutdown all steel mills throughout the United States. To avoid this potential harm to the national defense, the President issued an executive order placing control of all mills in the hands of the Secretary of Commerce.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The President is limited to vetoing and suggesting laws; he is not to create laws.

Facts
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. (Petitioner) complied with the Executive order but is now refuting the authority because Congress did not approve the order.

Issue
Did the President exceed the limit of his powers by issuing the seizure of all steel mills?

Held
Yes. The President may not make such an order without the direction of the Congress or under the express authority of the United States Constitution.

Dissent
The President was justified in his actions because the world is still recovering from war and he kept the Congress fully informed of his actions.

Discussion
The only time an order such as this would be sustained would be in the “theater of war.” In that case alone it would be appropriate for a military commander to take control of a supply center to prevent the disruption of the war efforts. Here, there was no such danger, only a perceived threat. Furthermore, the President acted alone without the support of Congress.
