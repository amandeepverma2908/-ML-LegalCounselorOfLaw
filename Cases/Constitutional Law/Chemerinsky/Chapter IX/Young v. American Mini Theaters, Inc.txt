Brief Fact Summary
Detroit, Michigan adopted a zoning ordinance that restricted the location of adult movie theaters and prevented too many to congregate near bars and other regulated establishments.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Content of speech may be used to restrict an activity, as long as the speech is not biased by such a restriction.

Facts
Detroit, Michigan adopted a zoning ordinance that restricted the location of adult movie theaters. The adult movie houses were not to be located within 1,000 feet of any two other “regulated uses” and was to be located more than 500 feet from a residential area.

Issue
Is a statute that regulates the location of adult movie theaters differently than regular movies constitutional?

Held
Yes. This law does not restrict the communication of the material. It just limits the location of the message.

Dissent
This is a time, place, and manner restriction. This type of restriction is to be used only with content neutral discriminations.

Discussion
The city imposes restrictions on regular theaters as well. This restriction, although directed at the adult entertainment, is not abnormally harsh or unreasonable. The number of theater licenses were not limited, therefore, speech was not prohibited.
