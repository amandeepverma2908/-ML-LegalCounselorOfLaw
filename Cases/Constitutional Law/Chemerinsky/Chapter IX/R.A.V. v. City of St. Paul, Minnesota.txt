505 U.S. 377, 112 S. Ct. 2538, 120 L. Ed. 2d 305, 1992 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
The Petitioner, R.A.V. (Petitioner), is a juvenile accused of burning a cross in his neighborâ€™s yard. This was done in violation of a city ordinance that prohibits such action.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Prohibition of the use of fighting words must be uniform across all topics or else the law is an unconstitutional restriction of speech.

Facts
In 1990, the Petitioner and some other juveniles made a cross out of table legs. They placed it in the yard of a black neighbor and set it on fire. The Respondent, St-Paul, Minnesota (Respondent), chose to prosecute the Petitioner under the Bias-Motivated Ordinance, which made it a misdemeanor to place a burning cross on public or private property, when someone knows or should know that this will result in anger by the victim.

Issue
Is the ordinance substantially over broad and unconstitutionally content-based?

Held
Yes. The ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. It is a content-based ordinance that does not fall into an exception of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.

Discussion
The ordinance prohibits fighting words only as they apply to cases of racial, gender or religious harassment. Other fighting words that are directed at political affiliation or homosexuality are allowed. Because of this prohibition of speech in particular areas, while others are unrestricted, is why the ordinance is held unconstitutional.
