405 U.S. 518, 92 S. Ct. 1103, 31 L. Ed. 2d 408, 1972 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
The Appellee, Wilson (Appellee), was convicted of using opprobrious words and abusive language towards police officers.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A statute must be carefully drawn and construed to punish only unprotected speech and not be applied to protected expression.

Facts
The Appellee was convicted of using abusive language towards another when he made statements such as “You son of a bitch, I’ll choke you to death.” “If you put your hands on me again I’ll cut you to pieces.” At the time these comments were made the Appellee was being moved away from an army induction center where he was protesting the war.

Issue
Is the Georgia law overly broad and unconstitutional?

Held
Yes. The definitions of the words used in the statute include non-fighting words as well as fighting words. Therefore, this statute is overly broad and unconstitutional as written and applied.

Dissent
The statute is constitutional.

Discussion
The majority relies on the definitions of the words used as a common dictionary defines them. Because the words include those that are meant to disgrace the listener or that are simply harsh words, the statute is not narrowly construed.
