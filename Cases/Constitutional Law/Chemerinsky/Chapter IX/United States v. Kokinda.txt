497 U.S. 720, 110 S. Ct. 3115, 111 L. Ed. 2d 571, 1990 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
The United States (Petitioner) prohibits the solicitation of contributions on postal property.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Solicitation is a protected form of speech subject to a reasonableness test. It may not be barred simply because the public official opposes the speakerâ€™s view.

Facts
Kokinda (Respondent) is a volunteer for the National Democratic Policy Committee. She set up a table on the sidewalk outside a post office where she intended to sell books and solicit contributions for the organization.

Issue
Can the government regulate this form of protected speech?

Held
Yes. This type of speech is disruptive to the activities of the post office.

Dissent
This is a public forum and the regulation is not a proper time, place, and manner restriction.

Discussion
The sidewalk at issue here, is not a traditional public forum because the sidewalk runs just from the parking lot to the post office. The sole purpose of the walkway is to assist patrons to get from their cars to the building.
