403 U.S. 713, 91 S. Ct. 2140, 29 L. Ed. 2d 822, 1971 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
The Petitioner, the New York Times (Petitioner), printed an excerpt from a top secret Defense Department document. The Respondent, the United States (Respondent), sought to enjoin further publications on the grounds that national security was jeopardized.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
There is a heavy presumption against the validity of any system of prior restraint of expression that can only be overcome by a significant governmental justification.

Facts
The Petitioner published excerpts from top-secret Defense Department documents that chronicled some of the decision-making that occurred during the Vietnam War. The documents were referred to as the Pentagon Papers. The Respondent immediately sought an injunction from further publications citing the compromise of national security as justification for the restraint.

Issue
Is this request for a prior restraint constitutional?

Held
No. The government failed to show sufficient justification for this restraint on expression by the press.

Dissent
Prior restraints are appropriate because of the sensitive nature of the reports.

Discussion
The majority simply relies on the holdings of the lower courts which prohibit governmental censorship unless the information will compromise national security at a time of war.
