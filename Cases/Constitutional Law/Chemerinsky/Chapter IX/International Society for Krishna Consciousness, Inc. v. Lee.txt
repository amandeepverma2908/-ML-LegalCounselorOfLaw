Brief Fact Summary
The International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., (Petitioner) was prohibited from distributing religious literature in a public airport.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Airports are not public forums; therefore restrictions need only be reasonable.

Facts
Petitioner participates in an annual “sankirtan” which is used to generate funds for the religion. Lee (Respondent) was the commissioner of the port authority in charge of implementing and enforcing the state regulation prohibiting solicitation in public airports.

Issue
Is an airport a public forum such that a regulation prohibiting solicitation in it violates the United States Constitution?

Held
No. This ban on solicitation is reasonable to prevent travelers from being interfered with unduly.

Discussion
The airport is not traditionally thought to be a public forum. The main purpose of the airport is to provide a place where people can embark upon their travel. They have no other choice than enter the airport and walk within it. To avoid Petitioner, travelers would have to walk around or find alternative means of travel. This infringement upon travel is a significant interest of the government that requires a degree of monitoring activity.
