Brief Fact Summary
Colorado requires that petition circulator’s wear a badge and that the names, addresses and amounts paid to all circulators be reported.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Protected political speech includes the freedom to remain anonymous while supporting a particular cause.

Facts
Citizens may get initiatives on the elections ballots by having persons sign a petition. In order to consider a petition valid, Colorado requires that all persons asking for signatures wear a name badge and that their address and amount received be reported to the state.

Issue
Do the Colorado state requirements violate the First Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution)?

Held
Yes. Affirm Court of Appeals

Dissent
The disclosure of circulators’ addresses and payment amounts slightly infringes upon the First Amendment of the Constitution and should be held constitutional.

Discussion
This kind of requirement is an even stricter restraint on speech than McIntyre because the circulators are required to discuss the issue at length in order to gain signatures. By providing the identity, the person is less likely to participate in the process. Therefore, this operates as a restraint on free speech.
