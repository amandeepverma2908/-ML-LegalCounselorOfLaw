Brief Fact Summary
There are three separate cases when regulations prohibited the distribution of handbills to members of the public on the street or sidewalks.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A citizen has the right to distribute information to others on the public streets.

Facts
Los Angeles code prohibits the distribution of pamphlets to people on the sidewalks and in cars. Petitioner was distributing a meeting notice to “Friends of Lincoln Brigade” where speakers would discuss the war in Spain.

Issue
Are these city restrictions constitutional?

Held
No. There are other less restrictive ways to prevent littering.

Discussion
As long as the distribution of pamphlets is peaceful the government has no legitimate interest in prohibiting this form of communication. A traffic jam or blockage of walkways is an important interest that may be significant enough to partially regulate the time, place, and manner of the communication, but it does not support a complete ban on speech.
