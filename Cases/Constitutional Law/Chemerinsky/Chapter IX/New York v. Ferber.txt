Brief Fact Summary
The Respondent, Ferber (Respondent), was convicted of distributing child pornography in violation of New York state law.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Child pornography is obscene without exception.

Facts
Use of children in pornographic materials has increased over the years causing the introduction of many state laws prohibiting such activity. The Respondent was a storeowner who sold material showing children under the age of 16 engaged in sexual activities.

Issue
Is child pornography a form of obscenity that may be constitutionally restricted?

Held
Yes. The prohibition on the sale and distribution of child pornography is constitutional even if the material is not obscene.

Discussion
These laws protect the children from being exploited and abused. This protection of children is a legitimate state interest that outweighs an adultâ€™s freedom to enjoy sexually explicit material.
