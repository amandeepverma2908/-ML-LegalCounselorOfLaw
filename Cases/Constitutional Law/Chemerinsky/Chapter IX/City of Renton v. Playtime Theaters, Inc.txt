475 U.S. 41, 106 S. Ct. 925, 89 L. Ed. 2d 29, 1986 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
The Petitioner, City of Renton (Petitioner), passed a zoning code restricting the location of adult movie stores within the city.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A regulation that is content-based on its face may be considered content neutral if it is motivated by a permissible content-neutral purpose.

Facts
The Petitionerâ€™s zoning code prohibited adult movie theaters from locating themselves within 1,000 feet of any residential area, church, park or school. However, they were not completely banned from the city.

Issue
Is this zoning ordinance a violation of First Amendment freedom of speech rights of the Respondent, Playtime Theaters, Inc. (Respondent)?

Held
No. The Petitioner had a substantial interest in avoiding the secondary effects of the adult stores and also allows the stores to be located in other areas of town. Thus, it is a constitutional content-neutral regulation.

Dissent
The ordinance places restrictions on establishments based on the content of the expression within it. Therefore, this is a content-based regulation.

Discussion
Because the ordinance does not ban the adult theaters completely, it is not content-based. As a content-neutral regulation it is subject to the time, place, manner analysis where a regulation is constitutional as long as it serves a substantial governmental interest and does not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication.
