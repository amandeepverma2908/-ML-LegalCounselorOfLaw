Brief Fact Summary
Members of the press were denied access to interview prison inmates in a face-to-face format.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The First Amendment does not guarantee the press special access to places not generally open to the public. The press has no right of access to prisons or inmates beyond what is given to the public.

Facts
Pell (Petitioner) challenges the constitutionality of the California code prohibiting press interviews with prison inmates. All requests to interview inmates in California prisons were denied.

Issue
Is it unconstitutional to prohibit the media physical access to prison inmates?

Held
No. The information sought can still be acquired via alternative means of communication. Therefore, the freedom of press is not denied in any way.

Dissent
This regulation improperly restrains the press from reporting on governmental conduct.

Discussion
The right to speech includes the right to communicate to any willing listener including members of the press. In this case, inmates could communicate via mail with the press. The state legitimately limits visitors to those who will be helpful in the rehabilitation of the inmate. The state interest in maintaining security of the facilities outweighs the right to speak to the press especially since there are viable alternative means of communication.
