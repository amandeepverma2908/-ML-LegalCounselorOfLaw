407 U.S. 163, 92 S. Ct. 1965, 32 L. Ed. 2d 627, 1972 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
The Appellee, Irvis (Appellee), requests that the Pennsylvania Liquor Board revoke the Appellant, Moose Lodge’s (Appellant), liquor license. Appellee claims that because the state of Pennsylvania issued the license, Appellant’s refusal to serve him was a “state action.”

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Being licensed by the state does not automatically convert private action into state action.

Facts
This is an action for injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. Section: 1983.

Issue
Is the issuance of a state license to a private entity, enough to convert the private actor into a state actor?

Held
No. The regulatory scheme enforced by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board does not sufficiently implicate the state in the discriminatory guest policies of the Appellant to make it a “state action.”

Dissent
Justice William Douglas (J. Douglas) wrote the dissent and was joined by Justice Thurgood Marshall (J. Marshall). They believed that the action of Appellant amounted to state action because of the regulatory scheme and license quota system in play at the time

Discussion
The majority indicates that to expand previous decisions to allow any state support to concert a private actor to a state actor is too broad a reading. This would eliminate the distinction between state and private action and make all private individuals subject to the Equal Protection clause.
