457 U.S. 922, 102 S. Ct. 2744, 73 L. Ed. 2d 482, 1982 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
The Appellant, Lugar (Appellant), owed the Appellee, Edmondson Oil Co. (Appellee) money. In order to prevent the Appellant from disposing of his property before paying his creditors, the Appellee filed an ex parte petition and had the local sheriff exercise a prejudgment attachment on the Appellant’s property.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Conduct is “fairly attributed” to the state when (1) it is caused by the exercise of a right created by the state and (2) the actor is one for whom the state is responsible.

Facts
The Appellant was a lessee-operator of a truck stop who owed his supplier, the Appellee money.

Issue
When is a private person’s actions so entangled with the actions of the government as to be construed as state action?

Held
In order for the Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) to find state action, a two-part test must be satisfied. First, the deprivation must be caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the state, or a rule of conduct imposed by the state, or by a person for whom the state is responsible. Second, the party charged with the deprivation must be a state actor by virtue of being a state official, by acting together with or getting significant assistance from a state official, or because his conduct is otherwise attributable to the state.

Discussion
Because the Appellee relied upon the state statute and the help of the sheriff, his actions were considered ’state action.’ Had the sheriff not been involved and the statute provided a self-help option for creditors, then Appellee would not have been classified as a ’state actor.’
