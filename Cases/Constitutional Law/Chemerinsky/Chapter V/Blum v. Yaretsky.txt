Brief Fact Summary
The Respondent, Yaretsky (Respondent), is a Medicaid recipient who was transferred from a nursing home to a lower level of care in a health related facility after case review by the nursing home’s utilization review committee. Respondent alleges that this transfer was done in violation of his rights and federal law under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution).

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Private entity decisions are not converted to state action simply because the state reacts to the decision.

Facts
Medicaid recipients have nursing home stays paid for by the City of New York if they meet specific eligibility criteria.

Issue
Did the decision by a nursing home committee to transfer a Medicaid patient to another facility violate his Due Process rights under the Constitution?

Held
No. The decision was based on independent medical judgment made by private parties. The fact that the state responded by adjusting the benefits does not make the state responsible for the decision to transfer the patient. There is no indication that these decisions were influenced by the state’s obligations to adjust payment accordingly.

Dissent
The majority oversimplified the problem by mischaracterizing the facts. The state is heavily involved in the placement of the patients, as this is just a legislative means of cost containment. The state encourages these “medical judgments” to help achieve its legislative goals. So, the state and the nursing homes are closely intertwined and interdependent for their financial survival.

Discussion
