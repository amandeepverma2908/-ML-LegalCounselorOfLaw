Brief Fact Summary
Massachusetts law requires state police officers to retire upon turning 50 years old. The Respondent, Murgia (Respondent), argues that this compulsory retirement denies him equal protection under the laws.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Age classifications are only subject to rational basis review.
