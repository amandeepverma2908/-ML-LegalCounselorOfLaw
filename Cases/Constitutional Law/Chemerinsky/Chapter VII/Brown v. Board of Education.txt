349 U.S. 294, 75 S. Ct. 753, 99 L. Ed. 1083, 1955 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
After ruling school segregation unconstitutional in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954) (Brown I), local school boards sought judicial guidance as to the appropriate remedy for the segregation.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Federal courts may sit in equity to enforce judgments of the Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court).

Facts
After Brown I, some of the defendant school districts met the ruling with great resistance. While some school districts readily adopted plans to desegregate their school systems, others sought guidance from the Supreme Court on the appropriate remedy for school segregation.

Issue
What is the appropriate judicial remedy for the damages caused by school segregation?

Held
Cases remanded to federal district courts for equitable resolution.

Discussion
Apart from the delay gained by asking for clarification of the principles of Brown I, the respondents in Brown II were asking for clear goals and guidelines for reaching compliance with Brown I. The Supreme Court disappointed them by not only not providing concrete guidelines, but also requiring the district courts to sit in equity over their compliance process – that is, asking that the judicial review of the school districts’ policies maximize its flexibility.
