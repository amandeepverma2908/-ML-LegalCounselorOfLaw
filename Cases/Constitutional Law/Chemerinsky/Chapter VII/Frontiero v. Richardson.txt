411 U.S. 677, 93 S. Ct. 1764, 36 L. Ed. 2d 583, 1973 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
A female Air Force Lieutenant sought increased benefits on the basis of her husband as a dependent, which were refused by the armed services’ policy of only allowing men to claim wives presumptively as dependents.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Gender-based classifications, like racial classifications, must pass strict scrutiny.

Facts
By statute, a serviceman may claim his wife as a dependent for purposes of qualifying for increased quarters, medical and dental benefits, and other increased support. However, a servicewoman may claim her husband as a dependant only if he is dependent on her for more than half of his support. The Petitioner, Frontiero (Petitioner), alleges that this policy denies her the equal protection of laws afforded by the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution).

Issue
Does the statute offering different spousal benefits for servicemen on the basis of gender violate the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection?

Held
Yes. Reversed and remanded.

Discussion
J. Brennan argues that gender-based classifications are always subject to strict scrutiny. J. Powell stops short of this, arguing that such a ruling would have far-reaching implications with respect to inherent differences between the sexes.
