403 U.S. 365, 91 S. Ct. 1848, 29 L. Ed. 2d 534, 1971 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
Arizona required State residents to be a United States citizen or a resident of the United States for at least fifteen years to be eligible for welfare benefits.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Restrictions based on alienage are generally subject to strict scrutiny.

Facts
The Respondent, Richardson (Respondent), was denied welfare benefits solely on the basis of being a resident alien who has resided for less than fifteen years in the country. The Respondent alleges that the residency requirement of the Arizona welfare statutes is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution).

Issue
May Arizona distinguish between resident aliens and citizens under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution?

Held
No. Court of Appeals ruling affirmed.

Discussion
The important holding of Richardson is that aliens are entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection and that in general, statutes based on alienage are subject to strict scrutiny.
