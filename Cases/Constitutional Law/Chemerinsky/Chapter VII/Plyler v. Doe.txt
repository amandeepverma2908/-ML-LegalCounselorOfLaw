457 U.S. 202, 102 S. Ct. 2382, 72 L. Ed. 2d 786, 1982 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
Texas denied the children of illegal immigrants free public education. Legal representatives of such children brought suit, alleging Texas’s statute violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution).

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The State may not deny free public education to the children of undocumented immigrants.

Facts
Texas law denied the right of undocumented children to attend public schools that were free to United States citizens and legal aliens.

Issue
May Texas deny undocumented children access to public schools without violating the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution?

Held
No. Appeals Court ruling affirmed.

Dissent
Chief Justice Warren Burger (J. Burger) notes that “the level of scrutiny employed to strike down the Texas law applies only when illegal aliens children are deprived of a public education,” and accuses the Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) of adopting a results-oriented approach. In the end, the dissent argues that illegal aliens have no expectation of any public benefits from the country in which they reside illegally.

Discussion
In a cynical view, the majority is trying to create a ruling that supports equity and fair play (why should children suffer for the illegal acts of their parents?), while the dissent argues that illegal aliens should be availed of nothing from the government whose laws they have circumvented, neither with a firm grounding in the language of the Constitution.
