Brief Fact Summary
New York State law prohibited non-citizens from being appointed state policemen. The Appellant, Edmund Foley (Appellant), was refused the opportunity to sit for the state police exam on the basis of his alien status.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When a state acts within its constitutional prerogatives, its classifications based on alienage are subject only to rational basis scrutiny.

Facts
New York law prohibited non-citizens from becoming state police officers. When the Appellant was denied the opportunity to sit for the state police exam because of his resident alien status, he sued, alleging denial of equal protection.

Issue
May a State discriminate between aliens and citizens in comprising its police force?

Held
Yes, as long as there is a rational basis for such distinction. Appeals Court ruling affirmed.

Dissent
Justice Thurgood Marshall (J. Marshall) argues that loosening of the level of review in the present case is inappropriate. He argues that the position of police officer does not require policy-making and as such, is not incompatible with integrity of the political process.

Discussion
The majority changes the standard of review in certain situations, namely where the State is legislating within its “constitutional prerogative.” Strict scrutiny is no longer appropriate, but rather rational basis.
