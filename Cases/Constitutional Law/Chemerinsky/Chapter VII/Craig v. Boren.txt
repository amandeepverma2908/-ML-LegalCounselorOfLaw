429 U.S. 190, 97 S. Ct. 451, 50 L. Ed. 2d 397, 1976 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
Oklahoma State maintained different drinking ages between men and women for the consumption of 3.2% alcohol beer. The Appellant, Craig (Appellant), now alleges that this difference violates the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution).

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Gender-based classifications must satisfy intermediate scrutiny requirements to pass constitutional muster.

Facts
The State of Oklahoma prohibited the sale of “nonintoxicating” 3.2% alcohol beer to men under the age of 21 and women under the age of 18. Suit was brought against the State, alleging the law violated the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.

Issue
Does the Oklahoma statute violate the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution?

Held
Yes. Appeals Court ruling reversed and remanded.

Dissent
Justice William Rehnquist (J. Rehnquist) dissents on two levels. He believes that rational basis analysis is the appropriate level of scrutiny for gender-based classification. Furthermore, he believes that the intermediate scrutiny applied by the Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) is so “diaphanous and elastic” as to encourage judicial prejudice.

Discussion
Craig v. Boren establishes intermediate scrutiny as the appropriate level of review for gender-based classification. Intermediate scrutiny is distinguished from strict scrutiny at both the objective and means levels. Important government objectives (intermediate) v. compelling government objectives (strict) and substantially related (intermediate) v. narrowly tailored (strict).
