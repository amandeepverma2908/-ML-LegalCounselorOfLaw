402 U.S. 1, 91 S. Ct. 1267, 28 L. Ed. 2d 554, 1971 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
School districts undergoing desegregation under Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954) (Brown I), and Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294 (1955) (Brown II), sought clarification of their duties and the scope of federal district courts’ power under [Brown I/II].

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The scope of District Court authority is broad, but enters only when local school districts have not voluntarily brought themselves into compliance with Brown I/II.

Facts
In the wake of Brown II, many school districts still sought to maintain vestiges of their pre-Brown I segregated systems. Defendant school districts brought suit, alleging that District Courts had overreached their authority, broad as it may be, under Brown II.

Issue
What is the scope of District Court authority under Brown II?<br />	When is it appropriate for the court to invoke that authority?

Held
The authority is broad, but is appropriate only where local districts have failed to bring themselves into compliance with Brown I on their own accord.

Discussion
The Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) made clear that the federal courts have almost carte blanche in desegregating previously segregated school systems. However, their authority only exists when the local school boards “default” in their efforts to desegregate.
