Brief Fact Summary
Ballard (Respondent) was charged with defrauding the public by practicing a religion that he knew was false.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Religion is determined by the sincerity and depth of the belief, not by whether it is true or false.

Facts
Respondent was convicted of using the mail to defraud the public. He organized a religious group. He claimed that he had supernatural powers to heal the sick and diseased. The charge indicated that Respondent knew that these claims were false.

Issue
Is Respondent being unconstitutionally persecuted for his religious beliefs?

Held
Yes. Although Respondent’s religion seems incredible to most, it is not the role of a jury to determine its veracity. If this religion were subject to such a trial, then all organized religions would need to be treated similarly.

Dissent
The government cannot prove that Respondent knew something was false when it opts to separate religious sincerity from verity.

Discussion
The First Amendment protects the right to choose and practice a religion of the individual’s choice. This includes freedom to believe and freedom to act. Just because a religious doctrine cannot be proven does not mean that it is not a religion and not protected by the United States Constitution.
