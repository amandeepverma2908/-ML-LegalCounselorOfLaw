426 U.S. 833, 96 S. Ct. 2465, 49 L. Ed. 2d 245, 1976 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
The Appellants, National League of Cities (Appellants), brought suit challenging the constitutionality of the 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act (the Act), specifically the requirement that state governments pay their employees the new minimum wage and overtime.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution) acts to preserve the States’ sovereign authority and limit the Congress’ power to compel State actions.

Facts
In 1974, Congress amended the Act to, among other things, apply the Act’s provisions to public employers. Appellants allege that the requirements of the amendments will greatly increase the cost of operating state governments to the extent that the governments will require greater income or provide decreased public services. Appellants also argue that Congress has intruded upon powers left to the States in so amending the Act.

Issue
May Congress regulate the employment practices of state governments?

Held
No. Reversed and remanded. Justice William Rehnquist (J. Rehnquist) states that the Act would require states to substantially restructure traditional ways in which they have operated. He argues that this is a power reserved to the States and that to force States to comply with Congress’ view of how they should operate their traditional affairs destroys the States’ separate and independent existences.

Dissent
Justice William Brennan (J. Brennan) believes that the United States Supreme Court (Supreme Court) has erred in saying that the Constitution refers to the states’ sovereignty acting as a restraint on Congress’ commerce power and the political process allows the states to deal with such issues.

Discussion
National League of Cities v. Usery is the first attempt by the modern Supreme Court to establish a jurisprudence of state sovereignty based on the text of the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution.
