Brief Fact Summary
A father brought a suit on behalf of his two minor sons, seeking to enjoin enforcement of an act of Congress intended to prevent the interstate shipment of goods produced with child labor.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Congress’ power under the Commerce Clause cannot undermine the police power left to the States by the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution).

Facts
Congress passed a law which would prohibit the interstate transportation of manufactured goods produced by a factory, which within thirty days prior had allowed children under age 14 to work or children between the ages of 14 and 16 to work for more than a specified workload. The father of two employed, minor sons – one under 14, and one between 14 and 16 – brought suit as next friend to his sons, seeking to enjoin enforcement of the law as exceeding Congress’ authority under the Commerce Clause.

Issue
Can Congress control interstate transport in a manner that strongly impinges on the manufacture of goods?

Held
No.

Dissent
Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes (J. Holmes) dissenting.

Discussion
The dissent’s argument clearly undermines the majority view, and later Commerce Clause cases are in line with the dissent.
