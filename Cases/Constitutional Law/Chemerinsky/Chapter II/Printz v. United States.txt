521 U.S. 898, 117 S. Ct. 2365, 138 L. Ed. 2d 914, 1997 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
Various state chief law enforcement officers (”CLEOs”) brought suit, alleging that the interim provisions of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (the Act) unconstitutionally required state executive officers to apply a federal regulatory program.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
“The Federal Government may not compel the States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program.”

Facts
The Act called for the establishment of a national background check system for hand gun purchasers by November 30, 1998. In the interim, the Act required state and local law enforcement to do background checks before issuing firearm permits. The Petitioners, Printz and another county sheriff (Petitioners), alleged that this requirement overreaches the power of the Federal Government.

Issue
May Congress require state law enforcement agents to administer the background checks required by the Act?

Held
No. Appeals court ruling reversed and remanded.

Dissent
Justice John Paul Stevens (J. Stevens) reiterates his previous position that the Tenth Amendment’s borders should be established by the political branches.

Discussion
Printz extends the Tenth Amendment prohibition of compelling state action to administer federal programs from state legislatures New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992) to state executive agencies. New York addressed the issue of Congress requiring state legislatures to dispose of radioactive waste or take title to it, whereas Printz deals with the federal government requiring action of state and local executives.
