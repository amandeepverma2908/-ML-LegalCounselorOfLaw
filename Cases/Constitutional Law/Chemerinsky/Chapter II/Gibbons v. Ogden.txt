22 U.S. 1, 9 Wheat. 1, 6 L. Ed. 23 (1824)

Brief Fact Summary
The State of New York had issued an exclusive license to operate steamboats in New York waters to Fulton and Livingston. Their licensee and the Plaintiff – Respondent, Ogden (Plaintiff), sued the Defendant – Appellant, Gibbons (Defendant), for operating a competing ferry service.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The commerce power is a broad regulatory power.

Facts
New York issued an exclusive steamboat license to Robert Fulton and Robert Livingston, who licensed Plaintiff to operate a ferry service between New York City and Elizabethtown Port, New Jersey. When Defendant began operating a competing ferry service, Plaintiff sued. Defendant argued that because his ferry was licensed under federal law as “vessels in the coasting trade,” he had the right to operate his ferry, as well.

Issue
Is the scope of Congress’ power under the Commerce Clause narrow in scope?

Held
No. Reversed and remanded.

Discussion
Gibbons v. Ogden is the first case addressing the scope of the Commerce Clause. Chief Justice John Marshall lays (J. Marshall) the foundation for future Commerce Clause cases by broadly interpreting Congress’ power under the clause.
