528 U.S. 62, 120 S. Ct. 631, 145 L. Ed. 2d 522, 2000 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
The Petitioners, including Kimel (Petitioners), brought suit against the Respondents, the Florida Board of Regents (Respondents), a state employer under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA). Respondents argued that the ADEA does not effectively abrogate their sovereign immunity.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Legislation must be congruent and proportional to a legitimate end to abrogate sovereign immunity under Section: 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment (Section:5 of the Fourteenth Amendment) of the United States Constitution (Constitution).

Facts
The Petitioners alleged they were fired by their state employers because of their age. Their employers argue that Petitioners cannot bring suit against them without offending state sovereign immunity.

Issue
Does the ADEA effectively abrogate state sovereign immunity?

Held
No. Appeals court ruling affirmed. The Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) holds that the ADEA punishes very few behaviors that are unconstitutional and it is not congruent or proportional to its purported ends.

Dissent
Justice John Paul Stevens (J. Stevens) argued once more that the boundaries of federalism are best left to the political branches.

Discussion
Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents illustrates that state sovereign immunity is a judicial doctrine wholly apart from the text of the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution, and that the Supreme Court will continue to apply this judicially created doctrine.
