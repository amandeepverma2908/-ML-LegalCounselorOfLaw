379 U.S. 241, 85 S. Ct. 348, 13 L. Ed. 2d 258, 1964 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
Prior to passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (the Act), the Appellant, Heart Atlanta Motel, Inc. (Appellant) operated a motel which refused accommodations to blacks. Appellant intended to continue this behavior to challenge Congressâ€™ authority to pass the Act.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Congress may regulate the ability of commercial institutions to deny service on the basis of race under its power to regulate interstate commerce.

Facts
Heart of Atlanta Motel had 216 rooms available to transient guests and had historically rented rooms only to white guests. Appellant solicits business from outside the State of Georgia through advertising in national travel magazines and other media. Approximately 70% of its guests are from outside the state. Appellant contends that Congress has overreached its authority under the Commerce Clause in enacting the Act.

Issue
May Congress prohibit racial discrimination in hotel lodging under the Commerce Clause?

Held
Yes. Appeals court ruling affirmed.

Discussion
The first of the modern civil rights cases before the Supreme Court, Heart of Atlanta Motel, illustrates the plenary nature with which the Supreme Court had vested the commerce power. The view expressed by J. Douglas was eschewed by the majority, largely because in The Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3 (1883), the Supreme Court had ruled that Section: 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution could not regulate private behavior.
