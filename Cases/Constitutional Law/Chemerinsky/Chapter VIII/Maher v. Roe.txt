Brief Fact Summary
Connecticut Welfare Department limits state Medicaid benefits for first trimester abortions to those that are medically necessary.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) should not decide legislative policy.

Facts
The State Welfare Department limits funding for first trimester abortions to those abortions that are “medically necessary.” Indigent women brought suit, claiming that the statute denies them their constitutional right to an abortion.

Issue
May Connecticut regulate funding for abortions in a manner that discriminates against the individuals having non-therapeutic abortions?

Held
Yes. Appeals Court ruling affirmed.

Dissent
Justice William Brennan (J. Brennan) believes that the State is forcing women to carry children to term and thus is making reproductive decisions for the women.

Discussion
Understanding the majority opinion, one must understand that indigent woman have no funding for an abortion whether or not the State denies funding. As such, the State is not putting obstacles in the way of indigent women wanting abortion services.
