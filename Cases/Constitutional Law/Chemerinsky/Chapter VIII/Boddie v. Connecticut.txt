401 U.S. 371, 91 S. Ct. 780, 8 L. Ed. 2d 113, 1971 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
The Petitioners, Boddie and others (Petitioners), brought suit against the Respondent, Connecticutâ€™s (Respondents) divorce policies, which on average cost $60 per litigant. The Petitioners represent married indigents who cannot afford a divorce.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
If marriage is a fundamental right available to all citizens, divorce must be available to all citizens as well.

Facts
The average cost of a divorce in Connecticut is $60 per litigant. Currently, if an individual cannot afford the cost of divorce, he cannot file for one. The Petitioners allege that this denies indigents equal protection under the laws.

Issue
Does discriminating against indigents in applying for divorce violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution)?

Held
Yes. Appeals Court ruling reversed.

Dissent
Justice Hugo Black (J. Black) argues that because of the state-controlled nature of marriage, unless there is a specific constitutional prohibition against it, the State of Connecticut may do as it pleases.

Discussion
The majority says that a fundamental right cannot be denied to people on the basis of wealth. The dissent says that when a power is delegated to the States, there must be a specific constitutional provision to allow the Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) to rule a given statute unconstitutional.
