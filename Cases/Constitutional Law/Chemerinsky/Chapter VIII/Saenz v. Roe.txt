526 U.S. 489, 119 S. Ct. 1518, 143 L. Ed. 2d 689, 1999 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
A California statute required families to live in California for twelve months before becoming eligible for full welfare benefits. In the interim, they were limited to the amount payable by the State of the family’s prior residence.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
States may not discriminate against non-residents in such a manner that denies them the privileges and immunities enjoyed by the citizens of that State.

Facts
A California statute required families to live in California for twelve months before becoming eligible for full welfare benefits. In the interim, they were limited to the amount payable by the State of the family’s prior residence. For example, a family of two moving from Arizona would be eligible for only $275/month, where a California resident would be eligible for $456/month.

Issue
May a State discriminate against non-citizens who travel to the State with regard to current residents?

Held
No. Court of Appeals ruling affirmed.

Dissent
Chief Justice William Rehnquist (J. Rehnquist) disapproves of the use of the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Constitution and the insistence on viewing the activities as part of “travel.” J. Rehnquist notes that when a citizen settles in another State, he is no longer a traveler.

Discussion
The travel argument by J. Rehnquist is suspect. If he agrees that one is entitled to all privileges and immunities when traveling, why should one lose these when one becomes a citizen after traveling has ended.
