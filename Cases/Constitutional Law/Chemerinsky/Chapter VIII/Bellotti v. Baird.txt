Brief Fact Summary
A Massachusetts law required an unmarried minor woman to get consent from both her parents before procuring an abortion. If unable to do so, a superior court judge may issue a consent order.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A minor’s right to an abortion may be conditioned on parental consent, as long as there is an alternative procedure provided by the State.

Facts
Massachusetts required unmarried, minor women to obtain parental consent from both parents before allowing her to acquire an abortion. In the event that she was unwilling or unable to obtain such consent, she could petition in superior court for a determination that she is mature enough to make this decision, or even if she is not, the abortion is in her best interest.

Issue
May a State condition a minor woman’s right to an abortion on parental consent?

Held
Yes. Court of Appeals ruling affirmed.

Discussion
The main point of Bellotti is the balancing of the interests of the minor woman in terminating the pregnancy and the parents in having the ability to raise their offspring.
