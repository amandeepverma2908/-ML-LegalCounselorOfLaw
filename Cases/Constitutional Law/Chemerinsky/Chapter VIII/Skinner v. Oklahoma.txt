Brief Fact Summary
The Petitioner, Skinner (Petitioner), was sentenced to involuntary sterilization under Oklahoma’s Habitual Criminal Sterilization Act (the Act) and now alleges that the Act deprives him of equal protection under the laws.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The right to have offspring is a fundamental right, requiring a compelling state interest to interfere with it.

Facts
Oklahoma defined a “habitual criminal” as a person who, “having been convicted two or more times for crimes ‘amounting to felonies involving moral turpitude’ either in Oklahoma or another State, is thereafter convicted of such a felony in Oklahoma and is sentenced to a term of imprisonment in a Oklahoma penal institution.” Such habitual criminals could be subject to forced sterilization. The Petitioner had been twice arrested for theft offenses before being arrested and confined for armed robbery. During his third incarceration, the Act was passed and proceedings were instituted against him.

Issue
May the State sterilize an individual against his will for being convicted of three felonies involving moral turpitude?

Held
No. Supreme Court of Oklahoma ruling reversed.

Discussion
Skinner represents the Supreme Court of the United States’ growing awareness of the right to reproductive autonomy. Unlike later cases that focus on due process and a right to privacy, the majority in Skinner holds that sterilization in the present situation violates equal protection principles.
