381 U.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510, 1965 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
The Appellants, Griswold and others (Appellants), was arrested for providing information, instructions, and medical advice to married persons as a means to prevent conception.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Intimate marital relations lie within a zone of privacy into which the government may not intrude.

Facts
Connecticut law criminalized the use of chemical and mechanical contraception, as well as the counseling and aiding the use of such contraception. The Petitioner was the Executive Director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut. The Petitioner was arrested after providing information and instructions on birth control methods to married people.

Issue
May the government ban all use of contraceptives?

Held
No. Appeals Court ruling reversed.

Dissent
Justices Hugo Black (J. Black) and Potter Stewart (J. Stewart) dissented. They admit they find the Connecticut statute offensive, but believe that unless there is a specific constitutional provision otherwise, the remedy for such legislation is through the political branches, not the judiciary.

Discussion
The opinion of the Court in Griswold is unusual in that it relies on inferred rights in the Constitution. Furthermore, it is difficult to distinguish how the Supreme Court’s opinion is any more “correct” than the concurring opinions offered.
