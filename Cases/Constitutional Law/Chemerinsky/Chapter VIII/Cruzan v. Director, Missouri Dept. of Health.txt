497 U.S. 261, 110 S. Ct. 2841, 111 L. Ed. 2d 224, 1990 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
Nancy Cruzan’s (Ms. Cruzan) parents sought to withhold medical treatment from their vegetative daughter, but were denied because of insufficient evidence of Nancy’s intent. Ms. Cruzan’s parents now bring suit on her behalf, alleging she has a liberty interest in withdrawal of treatment.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
States are given wide latitude in determining how they give rights to patient surrogates.

Facts
Missouri denied the withdrawal of treatment request because Ms. Cruzan’s parents could not establish Ms. Cruzan’s wishes regarding such withdrawal by clear and convincing evidence. Ms. Cruzan had a discussion with a friend who testified in court that she said she would not want to be on life support, but this was the only evidence of her personal wishes.

Issue
Does Missouri have a legitimate state interest in tempering the liberty interests of incompetent patients?

Held
Yes. Appeals Court ruling affirmed.

Dissent
Justice William Brennan (J. Brennan) dissents, arguing that the State interest cannot outweigh Ms. Cruzan’s liberty interest in having treatment withheld.

Discussion
While the Supreme Court decides there is a liberty interest in requesting to withdraw treatment, the Ms. Cruzan’s family is not afforded the remedy they hoped for, as the Supreme Court also ruled that Missouri has a state interest in determining how that liberty interest is to be applied in the case of an incompetent.
