444 U.S. 996, 100 S. Ct. 533, 62 L. Ed. 2d 428, 1979 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant, United States President Jimmy Carter (Defendant), rescinded a treaty with Taiwan as part of recognizing the People’s Republic of China. The Plaintiff, United States Senator Barry Goldwater (Plaintiff), sued, alleging that the Senate must rescind treaties.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Questions of a purely political nature are nonjusticiable.

Facts
While recognizing the People’s Republic of China, the Defendant rescinded the United States treaty with Taiwan. Plaintiff sued, arguing that as the Senate must ratify treaties, the Senate’s approval is also required to rescind treaties.

Issue
Is the present case justiciable?

Held
No. Case reversed and remanded for dismissal. There is no majority opinion.

Dissent
Justice William Brennan (J. Brennan), concurring in judgment, dissents. He argues that the case is not ripe, as there has not yet been Congressional action, but argues that if there were, this is not a nonjusticiable political question as defined in Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962).

Discussion
In the absence of a majority opinion, Goldwater v. Carter represents both the United States Supreme Court’s (Supreme Court) political question jurisprudence and ripeness law.
