387 U.S. 136, 87 S. Ct. 1507, 18 L. Ed. 2d 681, 1967 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
The Petitioners, Abbot Laboratories (Petitioners), sought declaratory judgment on the 1962 amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) that required prescription drug manufacturers to print the “established name” of the drug on labels and other printed materials that referred to the drug.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Declaratory judgment is appropriate when the issues are fit for judicial decision, and there is undue hardship to the parties if such consideration were withheld.

Facts
The amended Act required pharmaceutical manufacturers to display the “established name” (to be established by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare) in type at least half as large as that used for any proprietary name or other designation for the drug on all printed materials referring to the drug. A group of 37 drug manufacturers (representing more than 90% of the nation’s prescription drug suppliers) brought this suit, alleging the Commissioner exceeded his authority by requiring the use of the established name every time the trade name was used in all printed matter relating to the drug.

Issue
Have appellants brought an action ripe for judicial review?

Held
Yes. Reversed and remanded.

Discussion
The general guidelines of Abbott Laboratories continue to apply in ripeness cases. Note that the concrete nature of the question (did the Commissioner overreach his statutory authority?) allowed the issue to be fit for judicial decision by an Article III court.
