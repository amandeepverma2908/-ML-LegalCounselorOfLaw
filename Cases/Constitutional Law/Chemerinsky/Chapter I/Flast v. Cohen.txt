392 U.S. 83, 88 S. Ct. 1942, 20 L. Ed. 2d 947, 1968 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
The Appellant, including Flast (Appellants), brought suit, claiming standing solely as taxpayers, seeking to enjoin expenditure of federal funds on religious schools. Appellants claimed such expenditures violated the Establishment and Free Exercise clauses of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution).

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Taxpayer standing is appropriate when the plaintiff challenges an enactment under the taxing and spending clause of the Constitution and the enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations on taxing and spending.

Facts
Congress had funded, under Titles I and II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (the Act), writing, arithmetic, and other subjects in religious schools. Appellants brought suit, claiming that these expenditures violated the Establishment and Free Exercise clauses of the First Amendment of the Constitution. The only claim to standing provided was that all Appellants were taxpayers.

Issue
Have the Appellants established standing to bring suit in an Article III court?

Held
Yes. Reversed and remanded.

Dissent
Justice John Marshall Harlan (J. Harlan) argues that the two requirements outlined by the majority do not establish that P has a personal stake in the outcome.

Discussion
The Supreme Court establishes a two-prong test that allows taxpayer standing without opening the federal courts to generalized grievances.
