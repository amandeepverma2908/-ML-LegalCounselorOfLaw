428 U.S. 106, 96 S. Ct. 2868, 49 L. Ed. 2d 826, 1976 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
Two Missouri physicians sued the state, charging that Missouri’s statute prohibiting Medicaid payments for abortions which are not “medically indicated” unconstitutionally interferes with the decision to terminate a pregnancy.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The rule prohibiting third-party standing should not apply when the relationship of the litigant and the one whose rights he asserts is significantly close and where there is some obstacle to the first party bringing a suit on his own.

Facts
Two Missouri physicians sued the state, showing that they had provided abortions to Medicaid-eligible patients. The state had denied payment for these services on statutory grounds. The physicians stated that they would continue to perform such procedures and stood to be denied payments in the future.

Issue
Do the physicians have standing to bring the suit when the immediately affected are indigent women seeking abortions?

Held
Yes. Court of appeals ruling affirmed.

Discussion
The Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) does not say that there must be an absolute obstacle to the directly affected party bringing suit, only that there is some genuine impediment (e.g., protecting the privacy of her decision to terminate a pregnancy, the imminent mootness of her claim, etc.).
