514 U.S. 211, 115 S. Ct. 1447, 131 L. Ed. 2d 328, 1995 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff – Petitioner, Plaut (Petitioner), sued the Defendant -

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Congress may not require the federal courts to reopen a case after a court has rendered final judgment.

Facts
In 1991, the Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) ruled that actions brought under Section: 10(b) and Rule 10(b)(5) of the Act must be brought within one year of discovering the facts leading to the violation and within three years of the violation itself. In response, Congress amended the law to allow cases filed before the decision to go forward, if they could have been brought under the previous law. Petitioner had brought suit prior to the decision, but the suit was dismissed in accordance with the Supreme Court’s ruling. Petitioner attempted to resume prosecution of the dismissed case.

Issue
May Congress require Article III courts to reopen cases on which they have passed judgment?

Held
No. Appeals court ruling affirmed.

Discussion
Justice Antonin Scalia (J. Scalia) argues Congress has violated the separation of the judicial and legislative powers, by requiring courts to set aside final judgments, which the framers of the constitution envisioned as dispositive.
