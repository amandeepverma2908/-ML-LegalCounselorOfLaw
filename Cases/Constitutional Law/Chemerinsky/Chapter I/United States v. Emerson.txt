Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant, Timothy Joe Emerson (Defendant), moved to dismiss his indictment under 18 U.S.C. Section: 922(g)(8) for possession of a firearm while being under a restraining order. The Defendant argued that the statute violated his rights under the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution).

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Second Amendment of the Constitution confers an individual right, which may not be abridged without due process.

Facts
During his divorce proceeding, a restraining order was placed on Defendant. Defendant was indicted for possession of a firearm while under that order, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section: 922(g)(8). Defendant claims that the statute is unconstitutional, as it abridges his right to keep and bear arms as guaranteed by the Second Amendment of the Constitution.

Issue
Does the Second Amendment of the Constitution confer an individual right to keep and bear arms?

Held
Yes. Indictment overturned.

Discussion
United States v. Emerson demonstrates several methods of analyzing the meaning of a constitutional provision including: (i) plain text, (ii) historical, (iii) structural, (iv) stare decisis, and (v) policy concerns. In this case, the Northern District of Texas balances the outcomes of the various methods and applies the result to the statute at hand.
