Brief Fact Summary
The Petitioner, Nixon (Petitioner), a former federal judge, asks the Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) to decide whether Senate Rule XI, as applied in his impeachment trial, is constitutional.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Impeachment trials are nonjusticiable.

Facts
The Petitioner, a former Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, was sentenced to prison for lying under oath to a federal grand jury. The Petitioner refused to resign from his post and continued to draw his salary while incarcerated. In the ensuing impeachment trial, the Senate invoked Rule XI, which allowed a Senate committee to receive evidence and testimony. The committee provided full transcripts and summaries to the entire Senate and more than the necessary two-thirds voted to impeach on two of the three articles. Nixon now appeals, arguing that Rule XI violates the impeachment trial clause, Art. I Section: 3, cl. 6 of the United States Constitution (Constitution).

Issue
Does Petitioner have the right to have the entire Senate receive evidence and testimony?

Held
No, impeachment trials are nonjusticiable.
