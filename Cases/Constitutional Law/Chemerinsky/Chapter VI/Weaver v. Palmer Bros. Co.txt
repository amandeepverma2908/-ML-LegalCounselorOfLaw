270 U.S. 402, 46 S. Ct. 320, 70 L. Ed. 654, 1926 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
A consumer protection act was passed that prohibited the use of shoddy as a filler for comforters. The Appellee, Palmer Bros. Co. (Appellee), is a manufacturer of comforters that use this material as filler and allege that the act is unconstitutional.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A restriction on the manufacturing of items is an interference with the contractual bargain between buyer and seller that can only be upset in the interests of state policing power.

Facts
Appellee manufactures nearly 3 million comforters a year of which 750,000 are filled with shoddy.

Issue
Does the provision forbidding the use of shoddy in comforters violate the United States Constitution (Constitution)?

Held
Yes. All evidence shows that the any harm to the health of the public is eliminated during sterilization. So, the restraint is unreasonable and arbitrary.

Dissent
If the legislature saw the spread of disease as a great danger and the use of shoddy was a prevalent practice in the manufacture of comforters, then it was justified in prohibiting the use of shoddy.

Discussion
The provision is ruled unconstitutional because the stateâ€™s concern and intent for instituting the law was eliminated as a concern by the results of scientific studies.
