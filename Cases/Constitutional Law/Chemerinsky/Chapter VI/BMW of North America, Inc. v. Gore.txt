Brief Fact Summary
The Petitioner, BMW (Petitioner), sold slightly damaged, new cars for full value and never told the buyers about the damage. The Respondent, Gore (Respondent), purchased one these damaged vehicles and was awarded actual damages, plus $4 million punitive damages.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Punitive damages may be imposed to further a state’s legitimate interest in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its repetition as long as they are not “grossly excessive.”

Facts
In 1990, the Respondent purchased a new BMW for $40,000 from an authorized dealer in Alabama. After 9 months he decided to take the car to a detailer to have it shined and cleaned. This specialist informed Respondent that his car had been painted to cover minor damage to the body.

Issue
Does an award of $2 million in punitive damages to the purchaser of one car exceed the constitutional limit?

Held
Yes. The award is “grossly excessive” as measured by (i) the degree of reprehensibility of the non-disclosure; (ii) the disparity between the harm or potential harm and (iii) the punitive damage award and the difference between the remedy and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in similar cases.

Dissent
The United States Constitution (Constitution) does not guarantee that awards will be fair and cases such as this should be decided and remain in the state courts. The Supreme Court has become overly concerned with “punitive damages that have ‘run wild’.”

Discussion
A state has the authority to protect its citizens from deceptive trade practices. But one cannot force its rules on another state and thereby punish a company for practices that are legal in another state.
