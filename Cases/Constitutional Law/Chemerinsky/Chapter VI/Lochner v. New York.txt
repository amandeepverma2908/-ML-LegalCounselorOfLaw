Brief Fact Summary
The Petitioner, Lochner (Petitioner), was convicted of a misdemeanor for violating the New York state statute that limited the number of hours a baker could work in a bakery.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A state may interfere with a person’s right to contract for his labor, only if such interference is reasonably related to a legitimate purpose such as the protection of public health, safety or welfare.

Facts
New York passed a statute that limited the number of hours a baker could work to no more than 60 per week, or 10 hours per day. Petitioner worked more than the stipulated amount and was convicted of a misdemeanor.

Issue
Is the state’s interference with a baker’s right to make a living by limiting the number of hours worked in a week or day a fair, reasonable, and appropriate exercise of its police power?

Held
No. There is no reasonable ground for interfering with the liberty of person or right to contract, by determining the hours a baker can work.

Dissent
Both dissents see the statute as an appropriate exercise of the state’s police power, designed to protect the health of the delicate manufacturing baker.

Discussion
The majority characterizes the statute as an interference with a person’s right to contract and earn a living. The idea that a baker is an occupation that puts the public at risk is dismissed as a simple notion. The position is compared to those who work in a steel foundry and coal mine. Clearly, those workers are put in and put others in danger when extremely fatigued.
