392 U.S. 409,88 S. Ct. 2186,20 L. Ed. 2d 1189,1968 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
The Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) held that 42 U.S.C. Section:1982 bars all racial discrimination in the sale or rental of property and thereby reversed the lower federal courts dismissal of the Petitioners’ Joseph Jones and others (Petitioners), complaint filed in response to Respondent, Alfred H. Mayer’s (Respondent), refusal to sell Petitioners a home based on their race.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
42 U.S.C. Section:1982 bars all racial discrimination, private as well as public, in sale or rental of property. The statute is a valid exercise of the power of Congress to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment.

Facts
Petitioners filed a complaint arguing that Respondent had refused to sell them a home for the sole reason that Petitioner is black. Relying in part on Section:1982, Petitioner sought injunctive and other relief. The lower federal courts dismissed the complaint, concluding that Section:1982 applies only to state action and does not reach to private refusals to sell.

Issue
Whether 42 U.S.C. Section:1982 bars all racial discrimination, private as well as public, in sale or rental of property?

Held
Yes. Judgment of the lower federal courts reversed. On its face, Section:1982 appears to prohibit all discrimination against African Americans in the sale or rental of property. Despite Respondent’s argument to the contrary, history shows that Congress meant what it said.

Dissent
The Court’s construction of Section:1982 as applying to purely private individuals is clearly wrong.

Discussion
Here, the majority uses congressional power to reach private conduct under the Thirteenth Amendment of the constitution, in order to hold that 42 U.S.C. Section:1982 bars all racial discrimination, private as well as public, in sale or rental of property.
