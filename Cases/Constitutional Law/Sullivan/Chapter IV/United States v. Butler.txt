Brief Fact Summary
Congress used its taxing and spending powers to regulate local agricultural production. The regulation was challenged as being outside the scope of Congressâ€™s powers.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Congress does not have an independent power to provide for the general welfare, separate from its power to tax and spend.

Facts
The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 (the Act), promulgated during the New Deal, was enacted by Congress to raise farm prices by cutting agricultural production. Under the Act, the Secretary of Agriculture could contract with farmers to limit the number of crops produced in return for benefit payments. The payments would come from a fund generated by taxes imposed on those farmers who exceeded their production limits. The tax was challenged as an unconstitutional control on agricultural production

Issue
May Congress use its taxing and spending power to regulate in areas that are traditionally the concern of the states?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Dissent
Congress undoubtedly has the power to tax the processing of agricultural products. Congress also has the power to use public funds to aid farmers, especially since the country is in the midst of a depression. Furthermore, Congress can limit those payments to only the farmers that reduce their crop production. Thus, there is no basis to make the Act unconstitutional because farmers have to promise to reduce their production.

Discussion
Congress cannot use its taxing and spending power to regulate in areas that are traditionally controlled by the states.
