Brief Fact Summary
A statute banning pharmacists from advertising the prices of prescription drug prices was found to be in violation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution) by the Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court).

Synopsis of Rule of Law
If there is a right to advertise, there is a reciprocal right to receive the advertising and it may be asserted by the consumers here.

Facts
Prescription drug consumers challenged a statute banning pharmacists from advertising the prices of prescription drug prices on behalf of the pharmacists. They claimed that the statute was unconstitutional and that the First Amendment of the Constitution entitled the consumers to receive the drug price information. The lower court invalidated the law on First Amendment constitutional grounds.

Issue
Whether the prescription drug consumers have standing to challenge the law?

Held
Yes. Judgment of the lower court affirmed. Where exists, as here, the protection afforded by the First Amendment of the Constitution is to the communication, to its source and to its recipients both. If there is a right to advertise, there is a reciprocal right to receive the advertising and it may be asserted by the consumers here. Therefore, the prescription drug consumers do have standing to challenge the law.

Dissent
In a democracy, the economic is subordinate to the political. The First Amendment of the Constitution does not mandate the Court’s “open door policy” toward such commercial advertising.

Discussion
Here the majority holds that speech is not taken out of the First Amendment’s protection merely because it is commercial in nature.
