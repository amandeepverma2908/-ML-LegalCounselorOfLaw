514 U.S. 549, 115 S. Ct. 1624, 131 L. Ed. 2d 626, 1995 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
The Gun-Free School Zones Act (the Act) of 1990 made possessing a gun within a school zone a federal offense. A 12th grade student (Lopez) was convicted of violating the Act when he brought a handgun to his high school.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The power of Congress to regulate activities extends only to those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. The Act neither regulates commercial activity, nor contains a requirement that the possession be connected in any way to interstate commerce.

Facts
Congress passed the Act making it a federal crime “for any individual knowingly to possess a firearm at a place that the individual knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is a school zone.” Lopez (D), a 12th grader, was convicted for carrying a concealed handgun into his high school. The Court of Appeals reversed the lower court on the grounds that the law was outside the scope of the commerce power.

Issue
Does the commerce power of Congress extend to activities that have no apparent connection to interstate commerce?

Held
No. The Court of Appeals is affirmed.

Dissent
(Breyer, J) Congress had a rational basis for finding a substantial connection between gun-related school violence and interstate commerce. Evidence exists that gun-related violence interferes with the quality of education in schools and education is related to economic viability.

Discussion
When an activity is not directly connected to commerce, the Congressional regulation will usually not be upheld, especially when the activity is traditionally regulated by the states.
