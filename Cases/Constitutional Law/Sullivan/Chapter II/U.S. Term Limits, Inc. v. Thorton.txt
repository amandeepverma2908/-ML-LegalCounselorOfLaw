Brief Fact Summary
The Arkansas State Constitution contained an amendment limiting the number of terms federal Congressional and Senatorial candidates from Arkansas could serve. The Arkansas Supreme Court held that the amendment was unconstitutional.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution) does not reserve rights for the States that were not within the original powers of the States.

Facts
An amendment to the Arkansas State Constitution prohibited an otherwise-eligible candidate for Congress from appearing on the election ballot, if that candidate had already served three terms in the House of Representatives or two in the Senate. The Arkansas Supreme Court held that the amendment was unconstitutional. The case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court (Supreme Court).

Issue
Can individual states add additional requirements for election to Congress other than those found in the Constitution?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Dissent
The States can exercise all powers that the Constitution does not withhold from them. The Constitution is silent on the issue of prescribing eligibility requirements for elected federal officials. Therefore, the States retain the power to add election requirements for federal officials within the state.

Discussion
The conflicting opinions of the majority and the dissent represent a common theme in Constitutional law, the attempt to balance federalism with state rig
