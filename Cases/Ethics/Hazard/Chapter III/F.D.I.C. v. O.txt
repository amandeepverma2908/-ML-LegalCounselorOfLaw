969 F.2d 744,1992 U.S. App.

Brief Fact Summary
A major law firm is accused of being complicit in serious corporate fraud.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An attorney’s duty is to the corporation as an entity, not to its owners, managers, or officers.

Facts
Defendant, national law firm O’Melvany & Myers, assisted American Diversified Savings Bank (”ADSB”) in preparing lengthy documents designed to attract investors to various real estate projects. They were alleged to have done so knowing that ADSB’s officers were engaging in massive fraud and that the company’s net worth was nearly zero. Defendant argued that it had no duty to ADSB or its investors to expose the company’s own internal fraud.

Issue
How much of a duty, if any, does corporate counsel have to the corporation and its investors to expose ongoing fraud?

Held
An attorney’s duty to the corporation should always supersede any duty it may have to its officers and managers.

Discussion
While it is easy for attorneys in the Defendants’ position to lose perspective as to whom they are representing, firms should always remember that they are retained to represent the best interests of a corporation, even if this means acting against the wishes of its managers.
