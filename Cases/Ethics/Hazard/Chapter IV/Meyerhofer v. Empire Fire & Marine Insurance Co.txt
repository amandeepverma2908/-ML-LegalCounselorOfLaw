497 F.2d 1190,1974 U.S. App.

Brief Fact Summary
An attorney named as a defendant in a securities law violation case wants to be able to use attorney-client privileged information to demonstrate his nonparticipation in the wrongful acts alleged by Plaintiffs.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An attorney’s right to reveal previously privileged information to insulate himself from liability for alleged wrongdoing.

Facts
Attorney Charles Goldberg was named as a defendant along with the insurance company that he had advised in this suit brought by a shareholder claiming a number of securities law violations. Goldberg argues that he was not a party to this wrongdoing, and wants to be able to use a copy of an affidavit previously submitted to the SEC to prove this. His co-defendants seek to enjoin the production of this information.

Issue
Was Goldberg justified in making this information public once he learned that he had been included as a co-defendant?

Held
Yes. An attorneys may circumvent the attorney-client privilege if the previously privileged information would protect them from allegations of wrongdoing.

Discussion
This is the only exception to the attorney-client privilege in which the attorney is allowed to waive the privilege. The privilege is otherwise solely at the client’s discretion.
