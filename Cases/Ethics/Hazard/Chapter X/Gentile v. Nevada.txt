Brief Fact Summary
Defense attorney was disciplined for a public statement made at a press conference in which he maintained his client’s innocence and implicated one of the government’s witnesses as the perpetrator.

He also suggested that this detective was a drug user and that several of the other witnesses were known criminals. The court succeeded in empaneling a jury that it believed to be unaffected by these statements, and Sanders was acquitted of all charges. Petitioner was later disciplined by the Nevada state bar for violation of its Rule 177 prohibiting public statements that the attorney should reasonably know have a “substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing” legal proceedings, and now appeals.
