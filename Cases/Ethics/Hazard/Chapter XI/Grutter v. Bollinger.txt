Brief Fact Summary

Synopsis of Rule of Law

Facts
Petitioner, Barbara Grutter, applied for admission to University of Michigan Law School in 1997 with an undergraduate GPA of 3.8 and an LSAT of 161. She was denied. Petitioner, who is white, is challenging the law school’s use of race as a factor in the admissions process.

Discussion
Grutter’s companion case, Gratz v. Bollinger, challenged Michigan’s undergraduate admissions policies. The Court struck down this policy, however, finding that it gave an overall advantage to minority students.
