Brief Fact Summary
Intended beneficiaries of a will drafted by Defendant allege that its negligent drafting deprived them of a substantial benefit.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Lawyers drafting documents on behalf of a testator owe a duty of care to the intended beneficiaries as well as the testator.

Facts
Plaintiffs, intended beneficiaries of the will of Eugene Emmick, brought a malpractice action against Defendant, the law firm L.S. Hamm, for preparing a will with a provision that was held to violationg the Rule Against Perpetuities. This alleged negligence deprived them of the proceeds from a residual trust, and they brought a malpractice action against Defendant which was dismissed by the lower court. Plaintiffs now appeal.

Issue
May a lawyer’s duty of care extend to nonclient beneficiaries of a client’s will? Should a lawyer be liable for a reasonable mistake of law regarding the Rule Against Perpetuities in California?

Held
Although Defendant had a duty to the intended beneficiaries as well as the client, but he should not be liable for his reasonable mistake regarding the Rule Against Perpetuities.

Discussion
This was the first case ever to depart from the general rule that only a client may assert a malpractice claim against a lawyer. Most jurisdictions would now allow an action on these facts.
