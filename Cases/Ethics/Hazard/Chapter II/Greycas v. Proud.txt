Brief Fact Summary
Defendant knowingly misrepresented the status of his brother-in-law’s property in an opinion letter used to secure a loan.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The tort of negligent misrepresentation and an attorney’s duty of care to an adversarial party.

Facts
Defendant, attorney Theodore Proud, wrote a letter to Plaintiff, Greycas, Inc., stating that his brother-in-law Crawford’s farm equipment had no prior liens on it to assist him in securing an emergency loan. After Crawford’s suicide, Defendant learned that the equipment was already heavily indebted and that Plaintiff had never performed the tax and judgment searches that he had claimed to have completed in his letter. Plaintiff is claiming negligent misrepresentation. Defendant argues that he had no duty of care to the Plaintiff in this situation.

Issue
May an attorney be liable for negligent misrepresentation to an adversarial party?

Held
Yes. Proud may be liable here as someone who generally supplies information and opinions to others in the course of their business transactions. Judgment stands, and Defendant is recommended for discipline.

Concurrence
Agrees with majority’s reasoning, but suggests that they probably didn’t have to reach issues of negligent misrepresentation or malpractice. Defendant clearly and openly lied in his letter, and Plaintiff’s reasonable reliance on this misrepresentation caused them injury. This misrepresentation was entirely indefensible.

Discussion
It is not entirely clear why Plaintiff is claiming negligent malpractice rather than outright fraud, which would have undoubtedly been more straightforward.
