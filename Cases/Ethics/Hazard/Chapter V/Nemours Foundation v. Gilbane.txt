632 F. Supp. 418,1986 U.S. Dist.

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff requests disqualification of Defendant’s firm due to an alleged conflict of interest arising from one of the associates assigned to the litigation.

Synopsis of Rule of Law

Facts
Plaintiff requests disqualification of Defendant Gilbane’s law firm, Biggs and Battaglia due to attorney Paul Bradley’s participation in a previous action in which he represented a co-defendant of Plaintiff’s.

Bradley is disqualified, but Biggs is not.

Discussion
The court’s broad application of this exception (originally intended for attorneys in the public sector) suggests a far more pragmatic and situational approach to disqualification by imputation than had been previously used. This approach not only allows for freer migration of attorneys between firms, but also provides a client with more flexibility to use the counsel of his choice.
