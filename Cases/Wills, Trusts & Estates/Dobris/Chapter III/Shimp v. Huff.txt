Brief Fact Summary
Decedent’s second wife sought her elective share and family allowance of the decedent’s estate.  The decedent had previously executed a contract or joint will with his first wife devising the his entire estate to other individuals.  The legatees of the joint will sought to prevent the second wife from taking her elective share and family allowance.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Based on the public policy of the marriage relationship, the rights of legatees under a contract or joint will are limited by the possibility that the surviving spouse might remarry and the new spouse might elect against the will.

The court found that the will was revocable but that the contract under which the will was executed might be specifically enforced in equity or at law.  In 1985 Lester married Lisa Mae and they remained married until his death.  Following Lester’s death the joint will was admitted to probate and Lester’s second wife sought to have the personal representative pay her family allowance and elective share of Lester’s estate.  The personal representative refused and Lisa Mae filed for declaratory relief.

Held
