Appellant Husband of Heir Daughter (Daughter) appeals the appellate court’s ruling in favor of Respondent Administrator (Respondent) that modified the lower court’s interpretation of a will such that the husband received nothing under the will.

But the intention is not matter of speculation or arbitrary conjecture. It is sought for in the language used; and when language or a certain collocation of words has once received judicial construction, precedents are formed which are followed in later cases. When a testator uses technical words, he is presumed to employ them in their legal sense, and that words in general ar
