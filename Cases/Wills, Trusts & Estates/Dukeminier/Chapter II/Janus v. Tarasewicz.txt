Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff, insured’s mother, appeals from a declaratory judgment wherein the trial court found there was sufficient evidence to conclude that the primary beneficiary under the insured’s life insurance policy, survived the insured, and therefore was entitled to the proceeds of the life insurance policy.

Survivorship is a fact that must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence by the party’s whose claim depends on survivorship.

Facts

Theresa was still standing when a nurse came to the scene and began performing CPR on Stanley.  Minutes later, at approximately 5:45pm, paramedic Ronald Mahon arrived and saw Theresa faint and go into seizures.  She was breathing on her own but her pupils didn’t respond to light.  In a paramedic’s report Mahon wrote that at approximately 6:00pm Stanley had “zero blood pressure, zero pulse and zero respiration.”  Paramedic Robert Lockhart arrived at 5:55pm and both Stanley and Theresa were unconscious with non-reactive pupils.

Held
