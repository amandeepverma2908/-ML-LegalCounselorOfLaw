Issue
Whether a surviving spouse may invade a deceased spouse’s trust and take their elective share, if the trust was established by a third party?

Held
No, a surviving spouse may not invade a deceased’s spouse’s trust and take their elective share if the trust was created by a third party.  A third party ahs no obligation sot support someone else’s property.  Property owned by a third party ahs never been a part of someone else’s spouse’s elective share “estate.”

Discussion
Most trusts are upheld that make testamentary dispositions at death but do no comply with the Statue of wills on a theory that the beneficiaries have a legitimate expectancy interest. However surviving spouses do not have a legitimate expectancy interests in their deceased’s spouse’s trust benefits.
