3 F.3d 113 (5th Cir. 1993)

Brief Fact Summary
Appellants, William H. Davis and Catherine L. Davis, denied Appellee, James L. Sheerin’s, rights inherent in his 45 percent stock share in W.H. Davis Co., Inc., (the corporation).  The trial court found Appellants actions as oppressive and ordered a buy out of Appellee’s shares.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A court, in equity, may order a buy out of stock if oppressive conduct is found.

Facts
In May of 1985, Appellee brought suit as an individual, and as a shareholder on behalf of the corporation against Appellants based on allegations of Appellants’ oppressive conduct toward Appellee as a minority shareholder and their breaches of fiduciary duties owed to Appellee and the corporation.

Issue
Whether Texas law permits a “buy out” as a remedy? If so, whether “oppressive conduct” warrants the application of a buy out? If so, whether oppressive conduct exists in this instant case?

Held
The trial court’s holding is affirmed.

Discussion
Although the Texas Business Corporation Act (Act) does not expressly provide for a buy out, Texas courts, under their general equity power, may decree a “buy out” in cases where less harsh remedies are inadequate to protect the rights of the parties. Although the Act does not explicitly provide for a buy out, it does recognize a cause of action for oppressive conduct.  Furthermore, other jurisdictions have recognized a buy out as an available remedy for oppressive conduct. Although the typical oppressive “squeeze out” techniques used in closely held corporations do not exist here, the court finds that Appellants’ actions to deprive Appellee of his interest in the corporation, breach of their fiduciary duties, and attempt to silence Appellee’s voice in the corporation are considered oppressive.
